Read **CONDITION_QUALITY_SUMMARY.txt** for the executive overview

### If you have 30 minutes:
1. Read the summary (5 min)
2. Review Sections 1-4 of **CONDITION_PAGES_QUALITY_REPORT.md** (25 min)
3. Understand the critical issues and priority recommendations

### If you're ready to start working:
1. Open **CONDITION_IMPROVEMENT_CHECKLIST.md**
2. Start with the URGENT section (groin-strains)
3. Work through HIGH PRIORITY items systematically
4. Check off completed tasks as you go

## 🎨 Content Quality Templates

### Gold Standard Examples
Use these as templates when creating/improving content:

**Complete condition (all fields):**
- `low-back-pain` - 12/12 fields, including researchInsights

**Excellent biomechanics:**
- `ankle-sprains` (308 words)
- `severs-disease` (291 words)
- `turf-toe` (275 words)

**Strong research support:**
- `low-back-pain` (4 entries with researchInsights)
- `knee-osteoarthritis` (4 entries with researchInsights)
- `ankle-sprains` (5 entries)

**Consistent excellence (foot conditions):**
All foot conditions have 11/12 fields with 4 research entries each:
- posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction
- mortons-neuroma
- metatarsalgia
- hallux-valgus
- hallux-rigidus
- turf-toe
- severs-disease
- tarsal-tunnel-syndrome

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Rebuild groin-strains** (2-3 hours)
   - Use `low-back-pain` as template
   - All 12 fields required

2. **Add biomechanics to hip conditions** (4-6 hours)
   - 9 hip conditions systematically missing this field
   - Use `ankle-sprains` biomechanics as model

3. **Add research to spine conditions** (2-3 hours)
   - 3 spine conditions need keyResearch sections

### Week 2-3: High-Impact Improvements
4. **Add differentialDiagnosis to top 20 conditions** (5-7 hours)
   - Improves internal linking and SEO
   - Enhances user education

5. **Expand brief pathophysiology sections** (3-5 hours)
   - 9 conditions under 50 words
   - Target: 100-200 words each

6. **Add researchInsights to top 5 conditions** (2-3 hours)
   - Focus on most common conditions
   - Synthesize research findings

### Week 4-8: Comprehensive Improvements
7. Complete remaining differentialDiagnosis (5-6 hours)
8. Add researchInsights systematically (10-15 hours)
9. Enhance single-citation conditions (10-15 hours)

## 📈 SEO and UX Impact

### Current Strengths
- ✅ 98% of pages have strong core content
- ✅ Evidence-based approach builds authority
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of 57 conditions
- ✅ Consistent structure improves user experience
- ✅ Strong research citations add credibility

### Improvement Opportunities
- ⚠️ Add internal linking via differentialDiagnosis (38 conditions)
- ⚠️ Expand research synthesis via researchInsights (55 conditions)
- ⚠️ Complete biomechanics for all conditions (16 missing)
- ⚠️ Ensure consistent depth across all conditions

### Current Risks
- ❌ Incomplete groin-strains page damages credibility
- ❌ Missing biomechanics reduces educational value
- ❌ Variable content depth creates inconsistent UX

---

## 📝 Content Development Guidelines

### Minimum Standards for EXCELLENT Tier
- ✅ 10-12 fields complete
- ✅ Pathophysiology: 100-200 words (educational depth)
- ✅ Biomechanics: 150-250 words (patient-friendly)
- ✅ Evidence-based treatment: 3-4 approaches with evidence levels
- ✅ Key research: Minimum 2-3 entries with proper citations
- ✅ Clear clinical presentation
- ✅ Realistic prognosis with timeline and factors

### Writing Style Guidelines
1. **Pathophysiology**: Patient-focused explanation of tissue changes
2. **Biomechanics**: Real-world examples of movement/posture impacts
3. **Evidence**: Specific percentages, timelines, and outcomes
4. **Research**: Proper citations with sample sizes and findings
5. **Tone**: Professional but accessible, avoid jargon

### Consistency Requirements
- All conditions use `standardAccessAndHours`
- All conditions use `standardMeasuringProgress` (or custom)
- Evidence levels: "strong", "moderate", or "emerging"
- Word counts maintained in reasonable ranges
- Cross-reference related conditions in pathophysiology
