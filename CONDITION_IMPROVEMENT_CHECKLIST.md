## Notes for Content Development

### Writing Guidelines:
1. **Pathophysiology**: Patient-focused explanation of what's happening in the tissue
2. **Biomechanics**: Real-world examples of how movement/posture contributes
3. **Evidence**: Specific percentages, timelines, and outcomes
4. **Research**: Proper citations with sample sizes and findings
5. **Tone**: Professional but accessible, no medical jargon without explanation

### Consistency Checks:
- All conditions use `standardAccessAndHours`
- All conditions use `standardMeasuringProgress` (or custom if needed)
- Evidence levels: "strong", "moderate", or "emerging"
- Word counts maintained in reasonable ranges
- Internal condition cross-references in pathophysiology when relevant

### SEO Considerations:
- Include condition name in pathophysiology
- Link to related conditions via differentialDiagnosis
- Evidence-based language builds authority
- Research citations add credibility
- Comprehensive content improves rankings
