## 🐝 Hive Mind Design Audit Status

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (In Progress)
- [x] Codebase structure analyzed
- [x] Current design system reviewed
- [x] Build process verified (successful)
- [ ] Comprehensive visual audit
- [ ] Responsive design testing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance check
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline

### Identified Focus Areas

#### 1. Visual Consistency Issues
- **Typography**: Mix of Inter and Playfair Display needs better hierarchy
- **Color Application**: Gold palette (#B08D57, #D4AF37) needs consistent usage
- **Spacing**: Inconsistent padding/margins across sections
- **Shadow System**: Multiple shadow definitions need consolidation

#### 2. Responsive Design Gaps
- **Mobile Hero**: Needs refinement for premium feel
- **Touch Targets**: Must verify 44x44px minimum across all interactive elements
- **Breakpoint Consistency**: Some components don't scale smoothly

#### 3. Premium Polish Opportunities
- **Micro-interactions**: Limited hover states and transitions
- **Loading States**: Missing skeleton screens
- **Focus States**: Default browser focus needs custom design
- **Card Designs**: Can be elevated with subtle gradients and better shadows

#### 4. Performance Considerations
- **CSS Optimization**: Multiple style files could be consolidated
- **Animation Performance**: Need to verify 60fps on all transitions
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading not consistently implemented

#### 5. Accessibility Requirements
- **Color Contrast**: Need to verify all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Custom components need proper focus management
- **ARIA Labels**: Missing on several interactive elements
