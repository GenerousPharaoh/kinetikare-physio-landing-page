### Overview
Comprehensive refinement of the Services page to transform it from tacky/excessive to clean, modern, and premium. The goal was to create a sophisticated, understated luxury feel ($50K+ website quality) by removing excessive effects and improving typography.

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Reduced Excessive Spacing**
- **Before**: py-24/py-28 (96px-112px padding)
- **After**: py-12/py-16 (48px-64px padding)
- **Impact**: Better visual flow, sections feel connected rather than disconnected

#### 2. **Typography Refinement**
- **Font Weights**:
  - Changed all `font-bold` to `font-medium` for headers
  - Changed `font-semibold` to `font-medium` or `font-normal`
  - Added `font-light` to body text for modern feel
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Reduced hero text from `text-xl md:text-2xl` to `text-lg md:text-xl`
  - Process section title from `text-5xl md:text-6xl` to `text-4xl md:text-5xl`
  - Insurance section title from `text-5xl md:text-6xl` to `text-4xl md:text-5xl`
  - CTA section title from `text-4xl md:text-5xl` to `text-3xl md:text-4xl`
- **Impact**: Lighter, more modern typography that feels premium rather than heavy

#### 3. **Fixed Broken Hover States**
- **Critical Fix**: "Call for Support" button on dark background
  - Before: `bg-white/20 hover:bg-white/30` (text would become invisible)
  - After: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#D4AF37] to-[#B08D57]` (proper contrast maintained)
- **Impact**: All buttons now maintain proper contrast and readability on hover

#### 4. **Removed Tacky Elements**
- **Icon Shadows**: Removed all `drop-shadow-lg` and `boxShadow` from icons
- **Excessive Glows**: 
  - Removed `animate-pulse` from decorative elements
  - Reduced opacity of background orbs from 60-100% to 0-60%
  - Removed blur effects on icon backgrounds
- **Card Shadows**:
  - Reduced from `shadow-xl`/`shadow-2xl` to `shadow-sm`/`shadow-md`
  - Simplified hover states from complex transforms to subtle lifts
- **Impact**: Clean, sophisticated appearance without "trying too hard" effects

#### 5. **Updated Problematic Copy**
- **CTA Section Badge**: Changed from "Start Your Recovery" to "Next Steps"
- **CTA Section Title**: Changed from "Ready to Address Your Pain?" to "Continue Your Care Journey"
- **Description**: Updated to "Take the next step toward your recovery goals"
- **Impact**: More respectful messaging that acknowledges patients' existing efforts

#### 6. **Additional Refinements**
- **Stroke Widths**: Reduced icon stroke widths from 2.5 to 1.5-2 for elegance
- **Border Radius**: Changed some `rounded-3xl` to `rounded-2xl` for consistency
- **Transition Durations**: Reduced from 700ms to 500ms for snappier interactions
- **Transform Effects**: Reduced hover lifts from `-translate-y-4` to `-translate-y-1`
- **Scale Effects**: Reduced from `scale-110` to `scale-105` for subtlety

### Design Philosophy Applied
- **Less is More**: Removed excessive decorative elements
- **Subtle Elegance**: Replaced flashy effects with refined interactions
- **Modern Typography**: Lighter weights create sophisticated feel
- **Cohesive Spacing**: Tighter sections create better visual flow
- **Premium Feel**: Every change aimed at "expensive" perception without excess
