# Fixing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" Error in Next.js

## The Problem

This error occurs when there are issues with module resolution in webpack, typically when:

1. Multiple instances of React are being loaded
2. There are conflicts between different versions of the same package
3. The webpack configuration isn't properly resolving modules

The error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')` is often related to React hooks or webpack trying to call a function that doesn't exist due to incorrect module resolution.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Webpack Configuration Updates

The main fix was to update the webpack configuration in `next.config.js` to:

```javascript
// Ensure React is properly resolved
config.resolve.alias = {
  ...config.resolve.alias,
  react: require.resolve('react'),
  'react-dom': require.resolve('react-dom'),
};

// Make sure there's only one instance of React
config.resolve.modules = ['node_modules', ...config.resolve.modules];

// Ensure proper loading of React hooks
config.resolve.symlinks = false;
```

These changes force webpack to use only one instance of React and ReactDOM from your project's node_modules.

### 2. Output Mode Change

The `output: 'standalone'` setting in Next.js config can sometimes cause issues with module resolution, especially when using newer versions of React like 19.1.0. We've commented this out to use the default output mode which may be more compatible.

### 3. Babel Configuration

Added a `.babelrc` file to ensure proper transpilation with Next.js babel preset:

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": []
}
```

### 4. Module Resolution Config

Added a `jsconfig.json` file to help TypeScript/JavaScript properly resolve imports:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  }
}
```

### 5. Improved Debugging

- Added better debugging options in the npm scripts using `cross-env`
- Added a `clean` script to easily clear caches
- Set up `.env.local` with trace warnings enabled

## Things to Consider

1. Your project is using very new versions of React (19.1.0) and Next.js (15.3.1), which may have compatibility issues
2. The error may be caused by some specific component or library that's not properly handling React hooks
3. Server components vs. client components can sometimes cause issues with module resolution

## Next Steps

If the error persists:

1. Try running the app with the new `clean` script first: `npm run clean && npm run dev`
2. Consider checking for components that might be using hooks incorrectly
3. If the issue is specific to a certain page/component, try isolating it
4. Consider temporarily downgrading to a more stable version of React/Next.js
