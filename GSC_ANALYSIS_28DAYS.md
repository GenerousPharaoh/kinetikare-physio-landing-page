**Website:** kinetikarephysio.com  
**Period:** August 7 - September 3, 2025  
**Analysis Date:** September 5, 2025

## üî¥ Overall Performance: CRITICAL

### Key Metrics Summary
- **Total Clicks:** 24 (less than 1 per day)
- **Total Impressions:** 1,021
- **Average CTR:** 2.35%
- **Average Position:** 52.7

**Verdict:** Your website is essentially invisible in search results. These numbers are extremely concerning for a business website.

## üìä Trend Analysis: NEGATIVE

### Daily Performance Breakdown
- **Best Day:** August 28 (4 clicks)
- **Worst Days:** 15 out of 28 days had ZERO clicks
- **Recent Trend:** Only 3 clicks in last 5 days (Sept 1-3)
- **Impression Spike:** August 22 had 280 impressions but 0 clicks (position 63.99)

**The trend is NOT positive** - performance is erratic and declining overall.

## üîç Query Analysis: MAJOR PROBLEMS

### What's Working (Barely):
1. **"kareem hassanein"** - 9 clicks, position 1.7 (37.5% of all clicks!)
   - This is branded search from people who already know you
2. **"physiotherapy"** - 1 click, position 1 (but only 1 impression)

### What's Completely Failing:
- **Waterdown queries:** 489 impressions, 0 clicks
  - You're showing up for Waterdown searches but ranking positions 40-96
  - "sports injury rehab clinic in waterdown ontario" - position 79
  - "injury recovery services in waterdown ontario" - position 80
  - "back pain therapy in waterdown ontario" - position 86

### Geographic Mismatch Problem:
**You're ranking for Waterdown (where you work 2 days/week) but NOT Burlington (your primary location)**
- "burlington physiotherapy" - 3 impressions, 0 clicks, position 63
- "heel pain burlington" - 33 impressions, 0 clicks, position 81

## üì± Device Performance: Mobile vs Desktop Disparity

- **Mobile:** 17 clicks (71% of total), position 16.35, CTR 13.49% ‚úÖ
- **Desktop:** 7 clicks (29% of total), position 59.82, CTR 0.78% ‚ùå

Mobile users find and click your site; desktop users don't.

## üìÑ Page Performance: Homepage Dependency

- **Homepage:** 23 clicks (96% of all clicks)
- **About Page:** 1 click
- **Services Page:** 0 clicks from 201 impressions
- **All 47 Condition Pages Combined:** 0 clicks from 400+ impressions

Your condition pages are completely failing to attract clicks despite impressions.

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Visibility Crisis**
- Average position of 52.7 means you're on page 5-6 of results
- 64% of your pages rank beyond position 50

### 2. **Burlington vs Waterdown Problem**
- You're inadvertently targeting Waterdown (secondary location)
- Missing Burlington traffic (primary location)
- Need to strengthen Burlington signals

### 3. **Zero Commercial Intent Traffic**
- No clicks for "knee pain treatment", "back pain therapy", etc.
- Only getting branded searches ("kareem hassanein")
- Missing all high-intent physiotherapy searches

### 4. **Content Not Ranking**
- 47 condition pages generating 0 clicks
- Blog content invisible (rotator cuff exercises - position 81)
- Services page failing (0 clicks from 201 impressions)

## üí° Why This Is Happening

1. **Recent Google Updates** - March 2025 healthcare algorithm changes
2. **Local SEO Confusion** - Split between Burlington and Waterdown
3. **Competition** - Burlington Sports & Spine, Cornerstone, etc. dominating
4. **Domain Age/Authority** - Newer site competing with established clinics
5. **Link Authority** - Likely lacking quality backlinks

## üéØ Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1: Emergency Local SEO Fix
1. **Create Google Business Profile** if not done
2. **Get 10+ Google Reviews ASAP** (ask your recent patients)
3. **Add Burlington-specific content** to homepage
4. **Remove/reduce Waterdown mentions** except where necessary

### Week 2: Content Optimization
1. **Target long-tail Burlington queries**:
   - "physiotherapy north burlington palladium way"
   - "sports injury treatment alton village"
   - "back pain physio near appleby go"
2. **Add neighborhood pages** (despite your preference against)
3. **Internal link** condition pages to each other

### Week 3: Authority Building
1. **Get listed** on Burlington healthcare directories
2. **Partner** with local gyms/sports teams
3. **Create shareable content** about Burlington-specific topics

### Month 2: Technical & Content
1. **Speed optimization** (check Core Web Vitals)
2. **Mobile-first redesign** (since mobile performs better)
3. **FAQ schema** on all condition pages
4. **Case studies** with Burlington patients

## üìà Expected Recovery Timeline

**With aggressive action:**
- Month 1: Move from position 50+ to 30-40
- Month 2: Break into top 20 for some queries
- Month 3: Start seeing meaningful traffic (50+ clicks/day)
- Month 6: Achieve sustainable growth (200+ clicks/day)

## üî¥ Bottom Line

**Your website is in SEO crisis.** With only 24 clicks in 28 days and declining visibility, this needs immediate, aggressive intervention. The good news: your mobile performance and branded searches show the site works when people find it. The bad news: nobody is finding it.

**Priority #1:** Fix the Burlington vs Waterdown confusion
**Priority #2:** Build local authority through reviews and citations
**Priority #3:** Create Burlington-specific landing pages (I know you don't want them, but you need them)

This is fixable, but it needs action NOW before you lose more ground to competitors.
