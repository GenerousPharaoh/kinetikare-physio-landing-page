# Next.js Fix: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" Error

## The Issue

The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" in Next.js applications is typically caused by:

1. **Module Resolution Problems** - Multiple instances of React/React DOM being loaded
2. **Version Incompatibilities** - Using unstable or mismatched versions of React, Next.js, and their dependencies
3. **Webpack Configuration Issues** - Problems with how webpack resolves modules and dependencies

In this case, the issue was related to using extremely new and potentially unstable versions of React (19.1.0) and Next.js (15.3.1), along with a complex webpack configuration.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Version Downgrades

We downgraded several key dependencies to more stable versions:

```bash
# Core packages
npm install --save next@14.0.4 react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0

# Development dependencies
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-next@14.0.4 typescript@5.1.6 @types/react@18.2.0 @types/react-dom@18.2.0 --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Webpack Configuration Simplification

We simplified the Next.js configuration to focus on fixing the module resolution issues:

```javascript
// Ensure React is properly resolved
config.resolve.alias = {
  ...config.resolve.alias,
  react: require.resolve('react'),
  'react-dom': require.resolve('react-dom'),
};

// Make sure there's only one instance of React
config.resolve.modules = ['node_modules', ...config.resolve.modules];

// Ensure proper loading of React hooks
config.resolve.symlinks = false;
```

### 3. Removed Experimental Features

We removed experimental and potentially unstable features from the Next.js configuration that could contribute to the issue:

- Removed optimizeCss, scrollRestoration, and forceSwcTransforms
- Simplified the images configuration
- Removed complex optimization settings

### 4. Cache Clearing

We added commands to thoroughly clean caches that could be causing problems:

```bash
# Clean command (already existed)
npm run clean  # Removes .next directory and node_modules/.cache

# Added reset command for more thorough cleaning
npm run reset  # Removes node_modules, package-lock.json, and reinstalls dependencies
```

## Preventing Future Issues

1. **Stick with Stable Versions** - Avoid using bleeding-edge versions of React and Next.js in production applications
2. **Use Legacy Peer Dependencies When Needed** - The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag can help resolve dependency conflicts
3. **Simplify Configuration** - Keep webpack configuration as simple as possible
4. **Clean Build Files Regularly** - Use the provided `clean` and `reset` scripts when encountering strange errors

## If Issues Persist

If you encounter this error again:

1. Run `npm run reset` to perform a complete rebuild of dependencies
2. Check for multiple versions of React in your dependencies with `npm ls react`
3. Make sure your configuration doesn't have conflicting settings
4. Consider using a more stable version of Next.js and React
