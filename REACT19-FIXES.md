# React 19 & Next.js 15 Compatibility Fixes

## The Problem

This project was using React 19.1.0 and Next.js 15.3.1, which introduced breaking changes that caused compatibility issues with certain libraries and patterns:

1. **Module Resolution Errors**:
   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`
   - `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react/jsx-dev-runtime'`
   - `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-dom/client'`

2. **React 19 Breaking Changes**:
   - Direct ref access removed (accessing element.ref is no longer supported)
   - Changes in JSX transformation

## Applied Solutions

### 1. Version Downgrades

We downgraded to more stable versions:

```bash
# Core packages
npm install --save next@14.0.4 react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
```

### 2. Clean Reinstall

We performed a complete clean reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .next package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Compatibility Patches

We added compatibility patches for libraries that don't yet support React 19:

```bash
npm install @ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps
```

We created a dedicated compatibility file at `components/react19-compat.ts` that:
- Imports necessary compatibility patches
- Can be imported in client components that need compatibility with React 19

### 4. Component Architecture Updates

We simplified the component structure:
- Created a cleaner ClientWrapper component
- Added basic layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
- Ensured client components properly import the React 19 compatibility patch

### 5. Configuration Updates

We simplified the Next.js configuration in next.config.js:
- Removed experimental features
- Simplified webpack configuration
- Added explicit React module resolution fixes

## When Upgrading to React 19 in the Future

When you're ready to fully embrace React 19, follow these steps:

1. **Upgrade Packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
   ```

2. **Update Code for Breaking Changes**:
   - Replace any direct ref access
   - Ensure libraries are compatible with React 19
   - Review React 19 migration guide

3. **Remove Compatibility Patches**:
   - Remove imports of the compatibility patch
   - Remove the patch packages from dependencies
