# KinetiKare Physiotherapy SEO Improvement Report
## Comprehensive Analysis & Action Plan | September 2025

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of your website's SEO performance combined with extensive research on 2025 healthcare SEO best practices, your KinetiKare Physiotherapy website scores **7.2/10** for SEO optimization. While you've implemented strong technical foundations (structured data, Google Analytics, responsive design), there are critical gaps preventing you from dominating local search results in Burlington, Waterdown, Oakville, and Hamilton.

**Key Finding**: Your competitors are aggressively targeting local keywords and leveraging E-E-A-T signals more effectively, but you have unique advantages (CAMPT certification, MSc PT, direct billing) that aren't being fully utilized for SEO.
