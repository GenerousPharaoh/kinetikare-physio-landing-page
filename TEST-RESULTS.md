# Testing Results Summary

## Completed Test Setup

We have successfully set up comprehensive testing for the physiotherapy website:

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Created Playwright tests for the homepage, navigation, and performance/accessibility
2. **Route Tests**: Implemented a Node.js script that tests all routes
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Added GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
4. **Documentation**: Created detailed instructions for running tests in TESTING.md

## Initial Testing Results

### Route Testing

| Route | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| / | 200 | ✅ Success |
| /about | 500 | ❌ Error |
| /services | 404 | ❌ Not Found |
| /faq | 200 | ✅ Success |
| /success-stories | 200 | ✅ Success |
| /blog | 500 | ❌ Error |
| /blog/understanding-low-back-pain | 500 | ❌ Error |
| /nonexistent-page | 404 | ✅ Expected 404 |

**Success Rate:** 50.00%

### Issues Found

1. **Missing Routes**: The /services route returns a 404 error, indicating the page doesn't exist or isn't properly configured
2. **Server Errors**: Several pages (/about, /blog, /blog/understanding-low-back-pain) are returning 500 errors

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Server Errors**: Investigate and fix the 500 errors on the /about and /blog routes
   - Check for missing components, data fetching issues, or runtime errors
   - Review server logs for more detailed error information

2. **Add Missing Routes**: Create the necessary pages for routes that return 404 errors
   - Implement the /services page and any other missing routes

3. **Improve Error Handling**: Add proper error boundaries and fallback content

4. **Component Testing**: Add tests for key components beyond the current end-to-end tests

## Next Steps

1. Run the Playwright E2E tests once the server-side issues are resolved
2. Set up continuous integration to run tests on each commit
3. Implement visual regression testing for UI components
4. Add performance monitoring for critical user paths

These findings should be addressed to ensure the website is fully functional and provides a seamless experience for users.
