  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Sarah M.',
    age: 42,
    condition: 'Chronic Lower Back Pain',
    image: '/images/testimonial-sarah.jpg',
    quote: 'After 3 years of chronic back pain and trying various treatments with little success, I almost gave up hope. Working with Kareem completely changed my life. His manual therapy approach combined with a personalized exercise program not only relieved my pain but gave me the tools to prevent it from returning.',
    duration: '8 weeks',
    outcome: 'Pain-free with a maintenance program',
    story: 'Sarah came to me after suffering from debilitating lower back pain for over three years. She had tried various treatments including medication, general exercise, and even considered surgery. Using a combination of manual therapy techniques focused on the thoracolumbar junction and targeted exercises to strengthen her core and gluteal muscles, we were able to address the root cause of her pain. Sarah is now pain-free and actively participating in activities she had abandoned years ago.'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Michael R.',
    age: 35,
    condition: 'Post-Surgical ACL Rehabilitation',
    image: '/images/testimonial-michael.jpg',
    quote: 'As an avid soccer player, tearing my ACL was devastating. Kareem\'s expertise in post-surgical rehabilitation was exactly what I needed. His progressive approach challenged me at the right pace, and his knowledge of sport-specific training helped me return to playing even stronger than before my injury.',
    duration: '6 months',
    outcome: 'Full return to competitive sports',
    story: 'Michael came to me after ACL reconstruction surgery with the goal of returning to competitive soccer. We developed a comprehensive rehabilitation program that followed evidence-based protocols while being tailored to his specific needs. We focused on restoring full range of motion, rebuilding quad strength, and progressively introducing sport-specific movements. Through consistent work and dedication, Michael was able to pass all return-to-sport testing criteria and has returned to playing at a competitive level with improved biomechanics that reduce his risk of re-injury.'

  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Jennifer L.',
    age: 29,
    condition: 'Chronic Migraines & Neck Pain',
    image: '/images/testimonial-jennifer.jpg',
    quote: 'I had been suffering from chronic migraines and neck pain for years, which significantly affected my quality of life and ability to work. Kareem\'s treatment, combining manual therapy, dry needling, and a focused exercise program, has reduced my migraines from 3-4 per week to maybe 1 mild one per month. I finally feel like I have my life back.',
    duration: '12 weeks',
    outcome: 'Significant reduction in frequency and intensity of migraines',
    story: 'Jennifer was experiencing 3-4 debilitating migraines per week along with constant neck tension. After a thorough assessment, I identified significant restrictions in her upper cervical spine and tension in the surrounding musculature. We used a multimodal approach including manual therapy to improve joint mobility, dry needling to release trigger points in her suboccipital and upper trapezius muscles, and a progressive exercise program focused on deep neck flexor strengthening and posture correction. Jennifer now manages her condition independently with only occasional maintenance treatments.'

  {
    id: 4,
    name: 'David K.',
    age: 58,
    condition: 'Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy',
    image: '/images/testimonial-david.jpg',
    quote: 'As someone who enjoys golf and weightlifting, developing shoulder pain in my dominant arm was frustrating. Kareem\'s approach was different from other therapists I\'d seenâ€”he focused on finding the cause rather than just treating symptoms. The combination of hands-on treatment and his carefully designed exercise program has completely resolved my pain.',
    duration: '10 weeks',
    outcome: 'Full resolution of pain and return to activities',
    story: 'David presented with right shoulder pain that had been progressively worsening over 6 months. Diagnostic imaging showed rotator cuff tendinopathy without full tears. Our treatment focused on improving scapular control, addressing posterior capsule tightness through manual therapy, and a progressive loading program for the rotator cuff muscles. We also modified his weightlifting and golf techniques to reduce strain on the affected tissues. David has returned to both activities pain-free and with improved performance.'
