  'low-back-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Mechanical low back pain typically involves dysfunction of the intervertebral discs, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or surrounding musculature. The disc starts to lose its hydration and load distribution capabilities, which leads to increased stress on surrounding structures.

The deep stabilizing muscles like multifidus and transverse abdominis often show delayed activation patterns, compromising segmental stability. Over time, this can lead to movement pattern changes that perpetuate the problem.

When pain persists beyond 3 months, changes in the nervous system can amplify pain perception, making previously non-painful movements uncomfortable.`,
