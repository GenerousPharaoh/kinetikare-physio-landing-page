  'low-back-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Mechanical low back pain typically involves dysfunction of the intervertebral discs, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or surrounding musculature. The disc starts to lose its hydration and load distribution capabilities, which leads to increased stress on surrounding structures.

The deep stabilizing muscles like multifidus and transverse abdominis often show delayed activation patterns, compromising segmental stability. Over time, this can lead to movement pattern changes that perpetuate the problem.

When pain persists beyond 3 months, changes in the nervous system can amplify pain perception, making previously non-painful movements uncomfortable. When disc dysfunction progresses significantly, it may lead to disc herniation with potential nerve root compression (sciatica). Similarly, when facet joints become primary pain generators, this can develop into facet joint syndrome, while sacroiliac joint dysfunction may become a distinct condition requiring specific treatment approaches.`,

    biomechanics: `Poor posture and prolonged sitting create significant loads on your spine, particularly when you slouch or crane your head forward. Your core muscles - the deep abdominals and back extensors that act like an internal corset - often become weakened from inactivity, reducing the support they provide to your spine.

Heavy lifting with poor technique multiplies the forces through your discs. When you bend at the waist rather than squatting, you can increase disc pressure by up to 300%. Repetitive bending and twisting movements, especially under load, create the perfect storm for tissue overload.

Modern lifestyle factors play a huge role: prolonged sitting increases disc pressure by 40% compared to standing, and forward head posture from screen time changes how forces distribute through your entire spine. Even factors like tight hip flexors from sitting can alter your lumbar curve, forcing your back muscles to work overtime to maintain upright posture.`,

  'neck-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Neck pain involves complex interactions between joints, muscles, and nerves. The small joints in your neck bear significant load during daily activities, especially with modern computer use. The deep stabilizing muscles often become weak while surface muscles overwork to compensate.

The upper part of your neck is responsible for half of all neck rotation and can refer pain to the head. This explains why neck problems often cause headaches.`,

    biomechanics: `Forward head posture is the biggest culprit I see in my clinic. When your head sits forward of your shoulders, it multiplies the weight your neck muscles must support - every inch forward doubles the effective weight of your head. Your average head weighs about 10 pounds, but with forward posture, your neck muscles work as if supporting 20-40 pounds.

Screen work compounds this by requiring you to look down or crane forward, while your upper shoulders creep up toward your ears. This creates a cascade where your deep neck stabilizers weaken while your larger, more superficial muscles overwork and become tight.

Sleep position plays a role too - pillows that are too high or too flat force your neck into awkward positions for hours. Combined with stress-related muscle tension and the repetitive nature of modern work, these factors create the perfect environment for neck pain to develop and persist.`,

  'sciatica': {
    pathophysiology: `Sciatica describes pain along the sciatic nerve path, usually from compression or irritation at the spine level. The nerve can be affected by disc material, bone spurs, or tight muscles along its path. Similar to general low back pain, sciatica often involves disc dysfunction, but with the added complexity of nerve root compression or irritation.

When the nerve is irritated, it can cause pain, numbness, or weakness anywhere along its path from the back to the foot. The location and type of symptoms help identify where the problem originates. In some cases, sciatica may occur alongside degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis, requiring careful assessment to address all contributing factors.`,

    biomechanics: `Prolonged sitting is one of the biggest culprits I see with sciatica. When you sit, especially with poor posture, you increase the pressure on your lumbar discs by up to 40% compared to standing. This forward-slumped position narrows the spaces where nerves exit your spine, potentially compressing the nerve roots that form your sciatic nerve.

Poor lifting mechanics multiply the problem. When you bend at your waist with a rounded back instead of squatting down, you can increase disc pressure by 300%. Combined with lifting weight away from your body, this creates massive compressive and shearing forces on your lower spine. Repetitive bending, twisting, and lifting - especially first thing in the morning when your discs are most hydrated and vulnerable - sets up the perfect storm for disc problems.

Your movement patterns throughout the day matter tremendously. Tight hip flexors from prolonged sitting pull on your lower back, forcing your lumbar spine into excessive extension. Weak glutes fail to stabilize your pelvis during walking and stair climbing, placing extra demands on your spine. Even something as simple as how you get out of bed or your car can repeatedly stress the exact structures that are already irritated.`,

  'rotator-cuff-injuries': {
    pathophysiology: `The rotator cuff consists of four muscles that stabilize and move your shoulder. These tendons can be injured through sudden trauma or gradual wear. The tendon tissue becomes disorganized and may develop tears.

Poor blood supply to certain areas of these tendons makes healing slower. Shoulder blade positioning and muscle imbalances often contribute to ongoing irritation. Rotator cuff injuries frequently occur alongside shoulder impingement, as both conditions share similar biomechanical contributors. In some cases, rotator cuff dysfunction can lead to compensatory patterns that contribute to frozen shoulder or shoulder instability.`,

    biomechanics: `Forward head posture and rounded shoulders create the perfect storm for rotator cuff problems. When your head sits forward of your shoulders, it pulls your shoulder blades into a protracted position, reducing the space under your acromion where the rotator cuff tendons pass through. This sets up impingement with every arm movement, particularly overhead activities.

Repetitive overhead movements in work or sports place massive demands on these small stabilizing muscles. Your rotator cuff has to work overtime when your shoulder blade doesn't move properly - and poor desk posture weakens the muscles that control your shoulder blade position. Over time, this creates a cycle where the stronger, superficial muscles like your deltoid compensate for weak rotator cuff muscles, leading to altered movement patterns.

The most damaging factor I see is the combination of poor posture with repetitive activities. Whether you're reaching overhead to stock shelves, swimming, or even just reaching for items in high cupboards, if your shoulder blade isn't positioned correctly and moving smoothly, your rotator cuff tendons get pinched and compressed with every movement. Age compounds this problem as the tendons naturally lose some of their elasticity and blood supply, making them more vulnerable to these mechanical stresses.`,

  'tennis-elbow': {
    pathophysiology: `Tennis elbow involves degeneration of the tendons on the outside of your elbow, primarily the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Despite the name, it's rarely from tennis. The tendon develops small tears and becomes disorganized rather than inflamed.

Repetitive gripping and wrist movements overload the tendon beyond its capacity to repair, leading to pain and weakness. Similar to golfers elbow (medial epicondylitis), tennis elbow is a degenerative tendinopathy rather than an inflammatory condition, though it affects the opposite side of the elbow and involves different movement patterns.`,

    biomechanics: `Poor wrist and grip mechanics are the primary drivers of tennis elbow. When you grip objects with your wrist bent back (extended) rather than in a neutral position, you place massive stress on the extensor tendons at your elbow. This is exactly what happens during computer use when you rest your wrist on a pad while typing, or when gripping tools with your wrist cocked back.

The grip itself matters enormously. Activities requiring sustained, forceful gripping - like using a screwdriver, carrying shopping bags by the handles, or squeezing a computer mouse - create eccentric loading on the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon. This tendon has to work overtime to stabilize your wrist while you grip, especially when the load is held away from your body with your elbow extended.

Repetitive activities compound the problem. Whether it's painting, using hand tools, or even playing tennis with poor technique, the constant contraction and relaxation of these small forearm muscles creates microtrauma faster than the tissue can repair. Computer work is a massive contributor - hours of mouse clicking and typing with poor wrist positioning creates the perfect recipe for overload. Even the way you lift objects matters: lifting with your palm down (pronated) and elbow straight places much higher demands on these tendons than lifting with your palm up and elbow bent.`,

  'whiplash': {
    pathophysiology: `Whiplash involves rapid acceleration-deceleration forces affecting neck structures. Multiple tissues can be injured including muscles, ligaments, joints, and discs. The initial inflammatory response is followed by muscle guarding and altered movement patterns.

Central nervous system changes can occur, leading to heightened pain sensitivity and slower recovery in some cases.`,

    biomechanics: `The biomechanics of whiplash are more complex than simple "back and forth" head movement. In a rear-end collision, your body gets pushed forward by the seat while your head initially stays put due to inertia. This creates a dangerous S-shaped curve in your neck - your lower cervical vertebrae extend backward while your upper neck flexes forward. This unnatural position occurs in just 50-75 milliseconds, faster than your muscles can react to protect you.

What makes whiplash particularly damaging is the combination of forces involved. There's not just extension and flexion, but also compression, shearing, and potentially rotation if you were turned when the impact occurred. Your head can weigh 10-12 pounds, but during the whiplash motion, the forces on your neck structures can multiply dramatically. The small facet joints, ligaments, and muscles that normally provide stability are overwhelmed by these rapid, excessive forces.

The speed of impact doesn't have to be high to cause injury - whiplash can occur at speeds as low as 5-10 mph. This is because the change in velocity (delta-V) matters more than absolute speed. Even minor fender-benders can generate enough force to stress neck tissues beyond their normal limits. Position matters too: if your head was turned, your seat wasn't properly adjusted, or you weren't braced for impact, the forces distribute unevenly, potentially causing more localized damage to one side of your neck.`,

  'frozen-shoulder': {
    pathophysiology: `Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) involves thickening and tightening of the shoulder capsule. The normally loose capsule becomes inflamed then fibrotic, severely restricting movement. The condition typically progresses through freezing, frozen, and thawing phases.

The exact trigger is often unknown but can follow injury, surgery, or periods of immobilization.`,

    biomechanics: `The development of frozen shoulder often follows a pattern of disuse and protective guarding. When your shoulder hurts, your natural response is to avoid moving it, which seems logical but unfortunately sets up a destructive cycle. The less you move your shoulder, the more the joint capsule tightens and adheres to itself, creating the "frozen" sensation.

Compensation patterns play a huge role in both the development and perpetuation of frozen shoulder. When your shoulder becomes stiff, you'll unconsciously start using your neck, upper back, and other shoulder to perform daily tasks. This creates massive overuse in these areas while your affected shoulder becomes progressively stiffer from disuse. I see this pattern constantly - patients come in with secondary neck pain and upper back tension from months of compensating for their frozen shoulder.

Poor posture compounds the problem significantly. Forward head posture and rounded shoulders, common from desk work or general poor posture habits, place the shoulder capsule in a shortened position. When the capsule becomes inflamed and begins to tighten, it contracts into this already shortened position, making the restriction even more severe. Risk factors like diabetes, thyroid conditions, or previous shoulder injuries seem to predispose the capsule to this inflammatory and fibrotic response, turning what might be minor irritation into a major restriction.`,

  'acl-injuries': {
    pathophysiology: `The ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is crucial for knee stability, preventing the tibia from sliding forward. Tears usually occur during cutting, pivoting, or landing movements. The ligament has poor blood supply, limiting natural healing capacity.

After injury, the knee loses rotational stability, leading to episodes of giving way and potential damage to other structures like the meniscus and cartilage. ACL injuries significantly increase the long-term risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, even with successful surgical reconstruction. Concurrent injuries such as meniscus tears or MCL/LCL sprains are common and require comprehensive management alongside ACL rehabilitation.`,

    biomechanics: `The majority of ACL injuries happen without any direct contact to the knee - they're usually the result of poor movement mechanics during cutting, jumping, and landing. The classic injury pattern I see involves a combination of knee valgus (knee caving inward), limited knee flexion (landing stiff-legged), and foot positioned too far from the body's center of mass. This creates massive rotational and shearing forces that exceed the ACL's capacity.

Landing mechanics are absolutely critical. When you land from a jump with straight or minimally bent knees, your ACL has to absorb enormous forces that should be distributed through your entire leg. Female athletes are particularly vulnerable to this pattern because they tend to land in more knee valgus and with less hip and knee flexion compared to males. Add in lateral trunk lean (shifting your body weight over one leg) and you create the perfect storm for ACL failure.

The "position of no return" happens during cutting movements when your foot plants and your knee starts to collapse inward while your body continues moving in a different direction. This typically occurs in the first 50 milliseconds of the movement - faster than you can consciously react. Poor hip strength, particularly weak glutes, contributes significantly because your glutes should control your thigh position and prevent excessive knee valgus. Fatigue makes everything worse, as tired muscles can't maintain proper alignment, especially late in games or training sessions.`,

  'disc-herniation': {
    pathophysiology: `Disc herniation occurs when the inner gel-like nucleus pushes through tears in the outer annulus. This can compress nerve roots or the spinal cord. The herniated material also releases inflammatory substances that irritate nerves.

Most herniations occur at L4-5 and L5-S1 levels in the lower back, or C5-6 and C6-7 in the neck.`,

    biomechanics: `Disc herniations are strongly linked to specific loading patterns and movement mechanics. The most dangerous combination is forward bending with rotation while lifting - this creates asymmetric loading that can cause the disc's outer ring to fail. When you bend forward and twist at the same time, you create massive shearing forces through the disc that are particularly damaging to the posterior and posterolateral aspects where most herniations occur.

Morning activities are particularly risky because your discs absorb fluid overnight, making them larger and more vulnerable to injury in the first hour after waking. Something as simple as bending over to pick up a sock or reaching for a toothbrush can be the final straw if your disc is already compromised. This is why many people report their disc injury happened during a seemingly minor activity.

Prolonged sitting followed by sudden movement is another classic pattern. When you sit for extended periods, your discs experience increased pressure and your hip flexors tighten. When you suddenly stand and bend forward, you combine high disc pressure with poor movement mechanics from tight hips and weak glutes. Poor lifting technique compounds this - lifting with a rounded back, lifting away from your body, or lifting while seated all dramatically increase the forces through your discs and make herniation more likely.`,

  'knee-osteoarthritis': {
    pathophysiology: `Osteoarthritis involves breakdown of cartilage, changes in underlying bone, and inflammation of the joint lining. It's not just wear and tear but an active process involving the whole joint. Muscle weakness, particularly quadriceps, accelerates progression. Previous injuries such as ACL tears or meniscus tears significantly increase the risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, as these injuries often lead to altered biomechanics and joint instability. Like other degenerative conditions, knee osteoarthritis may coexist with patellofemoral pain syndrome, particularly when both involve similar movement pattern dysfunctions.`,

    biomechanics: `Knee osteoarthritis isn't simply "wear and tear" but rather the result of abnormal loading patterns that overwhelm your joint's ability to maintain healthy cartilage. The most significant biomechanical factor is quadriceps weakness, which creates a devastating cycle: weak quads fail to adequately absorb impact forces during walking, stairs, and daily activities, placing greater stress on your knee cartilage. As the cartilage breaks down and becomes painful, you naturally become less active, leading to even greater muscle weakness.

Poor movement patterns compound the problem significantly. When your glutes are weak, you lose control of your thigh position, often leading to knee valgus (knee caving inward) during weight-bearing activities. This shifts the loading away from the healthy center of your knee joint to the edges, accelerating cartilage breakdown in these areas. Similarly, tight hip flexors from prolonged sitting alter your walking pattern, reducing knee extension during push-off and creating abnormal shearing forces through the knee.

Previous injuries create lasting biomechanical changes that predispose you to osteoarthritis. An old ACL injury, meniscus tear, or even a significant ankle sprain can subtly alter how you move, creating compensatory patterns that overload your knee joint in ways it wasn't designed to handle. Obesity significantly accelerates this process - not just from the extra weight, but because excess weight often leads to muscle weakness and altered movement patterns that multiply the mechanical stress on your knees during daily activities like stair climbing and getting up from chairs.`,

  'meniscus-tears': {
    pathophysiology: `The meniscus is fibrocartilage that cushions and stabilizes the knee. Tears can be traumatic (usually in younger people) or degenerative (older adults). Degenerative tears are often part of early osteoarthritis.

The outer third has blood supply and can heal, while the inner portion has poor healing capacity.`,

    biomechanics: `Meniscus tears happen through two distinct mechanical patterns. Traumatic tears in younger athletes typically occur during cutting or pivoting movements when the foot is planted and the knee twists, trapping the meniscus between the femur and tibia. This mechanism is particularly dangerous when the knee is slightly bent and rotates under load - like when you plant your foot to change direction in sports.

Degenerative tears follow a different pattern and are much more common after age 40. These develop gradually from repetitive compressive and rotational forces during normal activities. As we age, the meniscus becomes less elastic and more prone to tearing from everyday movements like squatting, kneeling, or even getting up from a low chair. The wear and tear is often accelerated by previous knee injuries, muscle imbalances, or activities involving repeated knee rotation under load.

Poor movement mechanics significantly contribute to meniscus problems. Weak glutes and hip muscles fail to control your thigh position, allowing excessive inward collapse of the knee during activities. This altered loading pattern places abnormal stresses on specific areas of the meniscus rather than distributing forces evenly. Tight IT bands or hamstrings can also alter knee mechanics, creating uneven wear patterns on the meniscus over time. Once the meniscus is damaged, it can catch or pinch during normal knee movement, creating mechanical symptoms like clicking, locking, or catching.`,

  'it-band-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `IT band syndrome involves irritation where the iliotibial band crosses the lateral knee. It's not friction but compression of sensitive fat pad beneath the band. Contributing factors include hip weakness, training errors, and biomechanical issues.`,

    biomechanics: `IT band syndrome is typically a hip problem disguised as a knee problem. Weak glutes, particularly the gluteus medius, fail to control your thigh position during running and walking. When your hip drops on one side during single-leg activities, it causes your thigh to angle inward (hip adduction), which increases tension in the IT band and compresses the sensitive tissue underneath it at the knee.

Running mechanics play a huge role in developing IT band syndrome. Overstriding (landing with your foot too far in front of your body), excessive crossover gait (feet landing across the midline), and running with too much vertical oscillation all increase IT band tension. Downhill running is particularly problematic because it encourages longer stride lengths and places greater demands on your hip stabilizers. When your hip muscles fatigue, your running form deteriorates, creating even more IT band stress.

Training errors compound the biomechanical issues. Sudden increases in mileage, running primarily on cambered roads (which creates uneven leg lengths), or consistently running in the same direction on tracks forces your body to adapt to asymmetric loading patterns. Tight hip flexors from prolonged sitting limit hip extension during running, forcing your IT band to work harder to stabilize your pelvis. Even factors like leg length differences or old ankle injuries can alter your gait pattern enough to overload one IT band. The key insight is that the IT band itself is rarely the problem - it's usually responding to poor control from the hip above.`,

  'ankle-sprains': {
    pathophysiology: `Ankle sprains involve stretching or tearing of ligaments, usually the lateral ligaments (ATFL, CFL). This damages mechanoreceptors, affecting proprioception. Without proper rehabilitation, chronic instability can develop.`,

    biomechanics: `Most ankle sprains happen when your foot lands in an inverted position (turned inward) with your body weight shifted over the outside edge of your ankle. This classic mechanism occurs because your lateral ankle ligaments are much weaker than the medial ones, making them vulnerable when your center of gravity moves over the lateral border of your foot. The dangerous moment happens when your foot makes contact with the ground while inverted - there's simply not enough time for your muscles to react and correct the position.

Poor landing mechanics significantly increase your risk. When you land on an unstable surface or with poor body control, your foot may contact the ground in excessive inversion before your peroneal muscles can fire to correct it. Your peroneal muscles normally act as a protective mechanism, but they need about 60-80 milliseconds to respond to a sudden inversion force. Unfortunately, an ankle sprain can occur in as little as 20-40 milliseconds - much faster than your muscles can react.

Previous ankle sprains create a vicious cycle of instability. The initial injury damages the mechanoreceptors in your ligaments that provide balance and position feedback to your brain. Without this proprioceptive input, you're much more likely to land awkwardly or lose balance, leading to repeat sprains. This is why people often say their ankle "gives out" or they have a "weak ankle" - it's not actually weakness, but rather poor balance control and position sense from the damaged ligament receptors.`,

  'achilles-tendinopathy': {
    pathophysiology: `Achilles tendinopathy involves degenerative changes in the tendon rather than inflammation. The tendon's collagen becomes disorganized and new blood vessels grow into the tendon. This can occur at the mid-portion or insertion.`,

    biomechanics: `Achilles tendinopathy typically develops from a combination of training load mismanagement and poor biomechanics. Your Achilles tendon has to handle forces up to 8-12 times your body weight during activities like running and jumping, making it incredibly sensitive to changes in load. The classic pattern I see is someone who increases their training volume or intensity too quickly, or returns to activity after a break without gradually building up their tendon capacity.

Running mechanics significantly influence Achilles tendon loading. A forefoot or midfoot strike pattern generally loads the Achilles more than heel striking, which can be problematic if your tendon isn't adapted to higher loads. Overpronation (excessive foot flattening) creates a whipping action in the tendon that can contribute to overload, particularly at the insertion point. Tight calf muscles or poor ankle flexibility force your Achilles to work harder during push-off and limit your ability to absorb impact forces effectively.

Footwear and training surface changes can trigger Achilles problems even in experienced athletes. Switching to more minimalist shoes or zero-drop footwear significantly increases the load on your Achilles. Running on hills, particularly uphill running which requires more plantar flexion power, or sudden increases in plyometric or jumping activities can overload the tendon. Age compounds these factors because the tendon naturally becomes less elastic and has reduced blood supply, making it more vulnerable to developing the degenerative changes characteristic of tendinopathy rather than healing normally from micro-damage.`,

  'shin-splints': {
    pathophysiology: `Medial tibial stress syndrome involves periosteal irritation and microtears where muscles attach to the tibia. It represents bone stress on a continuum that can progress to stress fracture without proper management.`,

    biomechanics: `Shin splints typically develop from a combination of training errors and biomechanical factors that overload the muscles and bone along your tibia. The classic scenario is too much, too soon - suddenly increasing your running mileage, intensity, or frequency without allowing your body to adapt. Your muscles, tendons, and bone all adapt to increased loads at different rates, with bone being the slowest to strengthen. When you progress faster than your bone can adapt, you get the painful periosteal irritation characteristic of shin splints.

Running surface and footwear changes are major contributors. Switching from grass or trail running to concrete or asphalt dramatically increases the impact forces your legs must absorb. Similarly, running in worn-out shoes or switching to shoes with different cushioning properties can alter the loads placed on your shins. Many people develop shin splints when they start a new running program on hard surfaces after being sedentary, because their bones haven't had the gradual loading needed to strengthen appropriately.

Biomechanical factors significantly influence shin splint development. Overpronation (excessive flattening of your foot) increases the eccentric load on the muscles along the inside of your shin as they work to control the foot's motion. Tight calves force these muscles to work harder to lift your foot during the swing phase of running. Hip weakness, particularly weak glutes, can alter your entire leg alignment, creating abnormal stresses throughout your lower leg. Even factors like running primarily on cambered roads or always running the same direction on a track can create asymmetric loading patterns that predispose one leg to developing shin splints.`,

  'golfers-elbow': {
    pathophysiology: `Medial epicondylitis involves degeneration of the flexor-pronator tendons at the medial elbow. Like tennis elbow, it's degenerative rather than inflammatory, with disorganized collagen and neovascularization.`,

    biomechanics: `Golfers elbow develops from repetitive gripping activities combined with wrist flexion and forearm rotation. Unlike tennis elbow, this affects the tendons on the inside of your elbow that control wrist flexion and gripping. The classic mechanism involves forceful gripping while your wrist is bent forward (flexed) - think about gripping a golf club during the downswing, using a hammer, or even carrying heavy bags with your wrist bent.

Computer work and manual activities are common causes outside of sports. Prolonged typing with your wrists bent down (rather than in a neutral position), using tools that require sustained gripping with wrist flexion, or carrying heavy objects with your palms facing down all overload these tendons. The position is particularly stressful when you combine gripping with forearm rotation - like turning a wrench or opening tight jar lids.

Golf technique issues are the classic sports-related cause, hence the name. Poor swing mechanics that create excessive wrist action during the downswing, gripping the club too tightly, or hitting the ground repeatedly during practice sessions all overload the flexor tendons. However, I see this condition more often from occupational activities than golf. Activities like carpentry, plumbing, cooking, or any job requiring sustained gripping while the wrist is flexed forward can gradually overload these tendons beyond their repair capacity, leading to the degenerative changes characteristic of golfers elbow.`,

  'carpal-tunnel-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Carpal tunnel syndrome involves compression of the median nerve as it passes through the wrist. Increased pressure in the tunnel from swelling, repetitive use, or anatomical factors affects nerve function.`,

    biomechanics: `Carpal tunnel syndrome typically develops from sustained or repetitive activities that increase pressure within the narrow carpal tunnel where your median nerve passes through your wrist. The key biomechanical factor is wrist position - any activity that keeps your wrist bent (either forward or backward) for extended periods increases pressure in the tunnel and compresses the nerve. Computer work is a classic culprit, especially when your keyboard and mouse are positioned too high or too low, forcing your wrists into sustained extension.

Repetitive hand movements, particularly those involving forceful gripping or pinching, significantly contribute to the problem. Assembly line work, using vibrating tools, playing musical instruments, or any activity requiring repeated flexion and extension of your fingers while gripping increases the mechanical stress on the median nerve. The combination of sustained wrist deviation with repetitive finger movements is particularly problematic because it maximizes the pressure within the carpal tunnel.

Poor ergonomics in daily activities compound the issue. Sleeping with your wrists curled under your pillow, holding your phone with a bent wrist for extended periods, or activities like knitting or crafts that require sustained pinch grip with wrist flexion all contribute to nerve compression. The position of your entire arm matters too - when your shoulders are rounded forward and your arms are internally rotated (common with poor desk posture), it can create tension throughout your entire arm that affects nerve function all the way down to your wrist.`,

  'de-quervains-tenosynovitis': {
    pathophysiology: `De Quervain's involves thickening of the tendon sheath around the thumb tendons (APL and EPB). This creates a stenosis that irritates the tendons with thumb and wrist movement.`,

    biomechanics: `De Quervain's tenosynovitis typically develops from repetitive thumb movements combined with ulnar deviation (bending your wrist toward your little finger). The classic movement pattern that triggers this condition is lifting or grasping with your thumb while simultaneously bending your wrist sideways. This combination creates maximum stress on the APL and EPB tendons as they pass through the narrow tunnel at your wrist.

New parent activities are a notorious trigger - repeatedly lifting a baby while supporting their head creates the perfect storm of thumb abduction and wrist deviation. The "baby lift" movement, where you scoop up an infant with your thumbs extended and wrists bent, places enormous strain on these tendons. Text messaging, smartphone use, and gaming can also contribute, especially when you use your thumb for extended periods while your wrist is in an awkward position.

Occupational activities involving repetitive pinching, gripping, or twisting while using your thumb are major contributors. Activities like hairdressing (using scissors), gardening (pruning with secateurs), or any job requiring sustained pinch grip with wrist deviation can gradually irritate the tendon sheath. Even seemingly minor activities like wringing out washcloths, opening jars, or using a computer mouse for extended periods can trigger symptoms if done repeatedly with poor wrist and thumb positioning. The condition is particularly common in women, possibly due to hormonal factors that affect tendon healing, combined with activities like childcare that involve repetitive thumb loading.`,

The most pervasive and damaging misconception about OA is that it's a simple "wear and tear" disease where the joint is worn out and nothing can be done. This is not the full picture. OA is a dynamic process involving the entire joint structure, and it does not mean your active life is over. It begins with articular cartilage breakdown (the smooth, white, slippery tissue covering bone ends), followed by subchondral bone changes, osteophyte formation ("bone spurs" - bony lumps growing in response to inflammation), and joint space narrowing. The process involves inflammatory mediators, altered biomechanics, and compensatory muscle weakness. Critically, pain is not directly proportional to radiographic changes - I have seen countless patients with "severe" OA on imaging who have minimal pain and excellent function, and vice versa. Your experience of pain is real, but it is not solely dictated by what an X-ray shows. 

The hip joint doesn't exist in isolation - when it becomes stiff and painful from OA, the body makes compensations. The most common is increased movement and strain on the lumbar spine and sacroiliac (SI) joint, which is why so many people with hip OA also develop low back pain. The knee can also take a hit - a stiff hip changes the way you walk, altering forces that travel down through the knee and ankle. Living with persistent pain is exhausting and can lead to fear of movement, anxiety, and feeling of fragility. This is where pain centralization comes in - over time, the nervous system can become sensitized, essentially "turning up the volume" on pain signals. Gentle, graded movement can help recalibrate the nervous system. Hip osteoarthritis may coexist with other hip conditions such as greater trochanteric pain syndrome or hip bursitis, and can develop secondary to previous conditions like femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or hip labral tears.`,

Then, you start to feel profound stiffness first thing in the morning, making it a real chore to put on your socks and shoes. Over months or even years, that ache becomes more persistent, and the stiffness takes longer to fade. The narrative I hear from patients is consistent: a gradual closing down of their world. Activities they once loved, like hiking, gardening, or playing with grandchildren, are now shadowed by the thought of the pain that might follow. Classic presentation: age >40, activity-related groin pain, morning stiffness that improves with gentle movement, limited internal rotation on examination."

      firstVisit: "My assessment starts the moment you walk into the room - I observe your gait for any subtle limp or protective patterns. When you describe your hip pain, I'm listening for the subtleties: is the pain sharp and sudden, or a dull, constant ache? The latter is more characteristic of OA. I want to know about the 24-hour pattern - pain worse at the end of the day suggests a load-related issue, while severe night pain could flag other, more inflammatory conditions. I'll ask about what makes it better - if gentle movement or a hot shower helps ease the morning stiffness, that points us further towards OA. The most important question is: 'What can't you do anymore that you wish you could?' This becomes our true north for goal setting. On the examination table, I'm looking for the classic signs: limited internal rotation (often one of the first and most significant motion limitations in hip OA), pain with passive motion (I'll carefully move the hip into flexion, adduction, and rotation - the FADIR test - to see if it reproduces your familiar pain), and muscle strength deficits, particularly the gluteus medius and maximus which are crucial for shock absorption and stability. The diagnosis of hip OA is clinical - based on the combination of your story and the physical exam findings. An X-ray can confirm the diagnosis but is not always necessary to begin treatment. We'll discuss the load-capacity model - explaining that pain occurs when the load on your hip exceeds its current capacity to handle that load.",

  'femoroacetabular-impingement': {
    pathophysiology: `Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) syndrome involves abnormal contact between the femoral neck and acetabular rim during hip movement, specifically during deep hip flexion and internal rotation. The biggest misconception is that having a certain hip shape (a "cam" or "pincer" morphology on an X-ray) automatically means you will have pain - this is false. Many elite athletes and pain-free individuals have these shapes. FAI is a syndrome, which means it's the combination of a specific hip shape plus symptoms plus clinical signs. The shape itself is not the problem; the problem is how you are loading that shape.

Two main types exist: CAM (extra bone on femoral head-neck junction creating a "bump" that makes contact with the socket during deep flexion) and PINCER (deep acetabular socket where the socket is too deep, causing the rim to contact the femoral neck). Mixed types with both morphologies are common. The cam shape can make contact with the socket and labrum (cartilaginous ring around the socket) during deep hip flexion, leading to a pinching sensation and potential stress on the labrum.

To avoid the pinching sensation, the body develops clever compensation strategies. A common one is to create extra movement through the low back and pelvis - instead of flexing at the hip to squat, a person might excessively round their lumbar spine (butt-winking). Over time, this can lead to low back pain. Similarly, a stiff and painful hip can cause the knee to collapse inwards during activities like running or landing, potentially contributing to knee pain.

When a specific movement consistently causes sharp pain, the brain learns to fear and avoid it. This leads to protective muscle guarding, where muscles around the hip (like hip flexors and adductors) become chronically tense in anticipation of pain. This tension can then become a secondary source of pain itself.`,

The pain is not a constant, dull ache like arthritis; it's a sharp, almost 'bony' block that appears with specific movements, particularly deep hip flexion or rotation. Patients often tell me, 'It feels like something is getting caught in there,' and they'll make a 'C' sign with their hand, wrapping it from the front of the hip to the side to show me exactly where they feel it. It only hurts when they perform specific movements - especially deep squatting, getting out of a car, or sitting for long periods in a low chair."

I want to know about your athletic history and daily activities. Are you a hockey goalie, a dancer, or someone who sits in a low office chair for eight hours a day? These activities all involve sustained or repeated deep hip flexion, which can be provocative. I'll ask you to show me the exact movement that brings on the pain - this functional demonstration is often more revealing than any specific test I can do. The hallmark test for FAI syndrome is the FADIR test (Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation) - I'll bring your knee towards your chest and then across your body while gently rotating the hip inwards. A positive test reproduces your familiar sharp, anterior groin pain. This test is highly sensitive, meaning if it's negative, it's less likely to be FAI. However, it's not very specific, as other conditions can also cause pain with this movement. I'll carefully measure your hip's internal and external rotation - a significant loss of internal rotation compared to the other side is a common finding. I'll also look for patterns of muscle imbalance - often, the hip flexors (like the TFL) are tight and dominant, while the deep gluteal muscles are weak and inhibited. My diagnosis comes from piecing together three key elements: your story (sharp, pinching pain with deep flexion), the positive clinical tests (especially the FADIR), and the presence of muscle imbalances and movement faults.",

  'greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS), previously called "trochanteric bursitis," is primarily a gluteal tendinopathy affecting the gluteus medius and minimus tendons at their insertion on the greater trochanter. For years, this condition was called "trochanteric bursitis," and the presumed treatment was rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory injections. We now understand this is often incorrect. Research has shown that the primary issue is frequently not an inflamed bursa, but a distressed gluteus medius or minimus tendon - a gluteal tendinopathy. The bursa can become secondarily irritated, but it's rarely the main driver. This changes everything. Treating a tendinopathy is not about rest; it's about managing load and progressively strengthening the tendon. The idea that you just need to "rest it" is perhaps the most unhelpful advice for this condition.

The condition involves a load-capacity imbalance where compressive forces (from positions that bring the IT band across the trochanter) and tensile loads exceed the tendon's ability to adapt. Postures that bring your thigh across the midline of your body can cause the iliotibial (IT) band to compress the gluteal tendons against the hip bone, a key source of irritation in GTPS.

Weakness in the gluteus medius and minimus doesn't just cause local pain; it degrades movement quality throughout the kinetic chain. When these muscles aren't doing their job of stabilizing the pelvis, you can develop a "hip drop" or Trendelenburg gait pattern. This leads to compensations everywhere: the tensor fascia latae (TFL) and IT band may become overworked and tight, the low back can be subjected to shearing forces, and the knee can collapse inwards (valgus), potentially contributing to patellofemoral pain.

Chronic tendon pain is frustrating because the pain is often worse with rest (like at night), creating a cycle of anxiety and poor sleep. Poor sleep, in turn, is known to increase pain sensitivity.`,

    clinicalPresentation: {
      primarySymptoms: [
        "Localized, tender, aching pain centered over the bony point on side of hip (greater trochanter)",
        "Pain radiating down the outer thigh, sometimes as far as the knee",
        "Severe night pain - hallmark symptom. Direct pressure of lying on affected side, or stretch from lying on opposite side can be highly irritating",
        "Start-up pain when getting out of bed or chair after being still (sometimes called 'start-up' pain)",
        "Pain with single-leg weight bearing activities and walking (especially up hills or uneven ground)"

        "Pain with crossing legs or prolonged standing on one hip",
        "Simple actions like getting out of car, climbing stairs, or standing up after sitting become potent triggers"
      ],
      typicalPattern: "The patient with Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome typically points directly to the side of their hip - the bony part you can feel, known as the greater trochanter. The story is rarely about a specific injury. Instead, it's about a pain that has crept in and become a persistent, nagging ache. The most common and frustrating complaint I hear is night pain. 'I just can't get comfortable,' they'll say. 'I lie on the painful side, and it hurts. I lie on my good side, and it still hurts.' Simple actions like getting out of a car, climbing stairs, or standing up after sitting for a while become potent triggers. It's a condition that profoundly disrupts sleep and makes everyday movements a painful chore. Common in post-menopausal women but affects all ages. Often linked to a sudden, unaccustomed spike in load - recently started new running program or 'boot camp' class with lots of single-leg work."

    },

    whatToExpect: {
      firstVisit: "The subjective history is paramount for GTPS. The story of pain with side-lying is a huge clue. I'll dig deeper: 'When you lie on your good side, where exactly do you put your top leg?' Most people will say they just let it fall forward, which puts the hip into a position of adduction and flexion, compressing the tendons. I'll ask about exercise habits - have you recently started a new running program or 'boot camp' class with lots of single-leg work? A sudden, unaccustomed spike in load is a classic trigger. Your age and hormonal status are also relevant, as GTPS is particularly common in post-menopausal women. My physical exam includes: direct, precise palpation over the greater trochanter (significant tenderness is a key sign), single-leg stance test (standing on affected leg for 30 seconds often reproduces lateral hip pain), and resisted strength tests for hip abductors. I may also use de-loading tests - testing abductor strength with the hip in a slightly abducted position often reduces compressive force and can be less painful.",
      earlyPhase: "Focus entirely on stopping compressive loads while beginning non-compressive strengthening exercises. Your number one job is to avoid postures and movements that compress the gluteal tendons against the greater trochanter. This means no crossing your legs, no 'hanging' on one hip when you stand, and meticulous attention to your sleeping position. Sleep modification is crucial - use pillows between knees and ankles to maintain neutral hip alignment.",
      progression: "Our philosophy is simple: calm the tendon down, then build it up. Gradual progression from isometric exercises (which can have pain-relieving effect) to functional strengthening, slowly building tendon capacity while respecting tissue sensitivity. Tendon healing is a slow biological process - consistency is far more important than intensity."

  'hip-labral-tears': {
    pathophysiology: `Hip labral tears involve damage to the acetabular labrum - a ring of fibrocartilage that runs along the rim of the hip socket (acetabulum), acting like a suction cup to enhance stability. The labrum provides a suction seal that maintains negative pressure within the joint, contributing significantly to hip stability. When torn, this can result in mechanical symptoms and altered joint biomechanics.

Critically, labral tears very often occur in conjunction with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). An X-ray or MRI can identify the specific bony morphology and assess the health of the acetabular labrum, but understanding the relationship between these conditions is crucial. A cam-type FAI morphology can make contact with the socket and labrum during deep hip flexion, leading to a pinching sensation and potential stress on the labrum over time.

However, not all labral tears are symptomatic - many people have labral tears without pain. The development of symptoms depends on the tear's location, size, the individual's activity demands, and importantly, the presence of underlying bony abnormalities like FAI. Treating an isolated labral tear without addressing underlying FAI morphology may lead to poor outcomes, as the mechanical cause of the tear remains unaddressed.`,

  'hip-bursitis': {
    pathophysiology: `Hip bursitis involves inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion the hip joint. The most commonly affected bursae are the trochanteric bursa (lateral hip) and iliopsoas bursa (anterior hip). However, true isolated bursitis is actually less common than previously thought, and this represents one of the most important diagnostic updates in hip pain management.

What was traditionally called "trochanteric bursitis" is now understood to be primarily Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS) - a gluteal tendinopathy affecting the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. For years, lateral hip pain was attributed to an inflamed bursa, and the presumed treatment was rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory injections. Research has shown that the primary issue is frequently not an inflamed bursa, but a distressed gluteus medius or minimus tendon. The bursa can become secondarily irritated, but it's rarely the main driver.

This distinction is crucial because treating a tendinopathy is not about rest and inflammation control; it's about managing load and progressively strengthening the tendon. True isolated bursitis typically occurs secondary to other conditions, direct trauma, or in rare cases, infection or inflammatory conditions. The bursa becomes inflamed due to mechanical irritation or repetitive friction, but this is usually part of a broader mechanical problem rather than an isolated inflammatory condition.`,

  'deep-gluteal-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Deep Gluteal Syndrome (DGS) is a comprehensive term that describes the entrapment or irritation of the sciatic nerve not just by the piriformis, but by a number of other structures in the deep buttock space, such as fibrous bands, the gemelli-obturator internus muscle group, or hamstring issues. The most common misconception is that all buttock and leg pain is "sciatica" coming from the lumbar spine. For decades, a condition called "Piriformis Syndrome" was used as a catch-all term for this type of pain. While the piriformis muscle can be involved, we now understand the situation is more complex.

The deep gluteal space is a busy anatomical neighborhood. The sciatic nerve must navigate a narrow tunnel surrounded by several deep hip rotator muscles like the piriformis. Irritation of the nerve in this space can cause DGS. This is the central mystery of DGS: buttock and leg pain that mimics a classic "pinched nerve" from the back, but originates from a completely different location - your back may be completely innocent.

The way you move can contribute to DGS. A gait pattern where the knee collapses inwards (valgus) can cause over-activity and eventual tightness of the deep external rotator muscles of the hip (like the piriformis) as they work overtime to try to control the femur. This tightness can contribute to nerve compression. Similarly, weakness in the gluteus medius or maximus can lead to compensatory strategies that overload these deeper muscles.

Living with nerve pain is unsettling. The tingling, burning, and unpredictable nature of the symptoms can create a high level of anxiety and fear. Patients often worry they have a serious spinal condition. Understanding that the nerve is simply "irritated" or "compressed" in the buttock, and not "damaged" in the spine, can significantly reduce fear.`,

      typicalPattern: "The patient with Deep Gluteal Syndrome comes in with a story that is often a diagnostic puzzle. They describe a deep, aching, and sometimes burning or tingling pain in the buttock. Unlike simple muscle pain, this discomfort often travels, running down the back of their thigh, occasionally even into the lower leg. The symptoms can be vague and unpredictable. Sitting is a major aggravator, especially on hard surfaces or while driving, as it feels like they are putting pressure directly on a 'hot spot.' They might tell me, 'It feels like sciatica, but my back feels fine.' This is the central mystery of DGS: buttock and leg pain that mimics a classic 'pinched nerve' from the back, but originates from a completely different location."

    whatToExpect: {
      firstVisit: "The clinical reasoning process for DGS is a true detective story. Your subjective report provides the first set of clues. I'm listening for details that point away from the lumbar spine. For instance, if the pain is primarily and most intensely felt in the buttock itself, and is made worse by sitting, that raises my suspicion for DGS. I will ask, 'Does coughing or sneezing make the leg pain worse?' A negative answer keeps the focus on the gluteal region. My physical exam is a systematic process of elimination: First, I must clear the lumbar spine - assess range of motion, perform full neurological screen (reflexes, sensation, muscle strength), and use specific tests like Straight Leg Raise and Slump Test. If these are negative, the likelihood of the problem originating in the lumbar spine decreases significantly. Next, I'll examine the hip and pelvis, assess SI joint with provocation tests. Finally, I'll perform specific tests designed to tension or compress the sciatic nerve in the buttock - placing the hip in positions of flexion, adduction, and rotation to see if this reproduces your specific buttock and radiating pain. DGS becomes the leading diagnosis when you have buttock and radiating leg pain, a negative lumbar spine examination, and positive findings on tests that specifically load the deep gluteal space.",
      earlyPhase: "Our philosophy is to create space and improve mobility. We need to reduce the compressive forces on the sciatic nerve, improve the health and flexibility of the surrounding muscles. Your first priority is to modify the activities and positions that are compressing the nerve. This means addressing your sitting posture (no wallets in the back pocket!), avoiding prolonged sitting on hard surfaces, and temporarily avoiding deep stretching that pulls the nerve taut. We implement sitting modifications and begin gentle exercises to create space and mobility. While aggressive stretching can be harmful, a gentle, sustained stretch can help to reduce tension in the piriformis and other deep rotator muscles, potentially decreasing the compressive forces on the sciatic nerve.",
      progression: "We introduce nerve mobility exercises and begin a progressive strengthening program for the larger gluteal muscles. We use 'slider' techniques - not trying to stretch the nerve but gently moving it back and forth through its anatomical tunnel. This can help to improve its mobility, reduce its sensitivity, and promote better physiological health of the nerve itself. We focus on building robust, functional strength to ensure the problem does not return - integrating compound movements that challenge the entire kinetic chain. By improving the function of the larger, more superficial gluteus medius muscle, we can reduce the compensatory over-activity of the deeper muscles (like the piriformis) that may be contributing to the nerve compression."

  'proximal-hamstring-tendinopathy': {
    pathophysiology: `Proximal hamstring tendinopathy is centered around one specific, exquisitely tender spot: the ischial tuberosity, or the "sitting bone." The pain is a deep, localized ache right in the crease of the buttock where the hamstring muscles originate from a thick, shared tendon. The most common mistake people make is treating this like a simple hamstring muscle strain and aggressively stretching it, which often makes it worse. A tendinopathy at the hamstring's origin is sensitive to both compressive and tensile loads. Aggressive stretching places a high tensile load on the tendon, while sitting on it directly compresses it against the ischial tuberosity. Both actions can perpetuate the pain cycle. The condition is often linked to altered running mechanics, commonly an "over-striding" gait where the foot lands too far in front of the body's center of mass, putting massive braking and tensile load on the hamstring at foot strike.`,

  'piriformis-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Piriformis syndrome, as traditionally understood, involves irritation of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle deep in the buttock. However, this represents an outdated understanding of buttock and leg pain. For decades, "Piriformis Syndrome" was used as a catch-all term for buttock pain with leg symptoms. While the piriformis muscle can be involved, we now understand the situation is more complex.

The more accurate and comprehensive term is "Deep Gluteal Syndrome" (DGS). This describes the entrapment or irritation of the sciatic nerve not just by the piriformis, but by a number of other structures in the deep buttock space, such as fibrous bands, the gemelli-obturator internus muscle group, or other anatomical variations. The deep gluteal space is a busy anatomical neighborhood where the sciatic nerve must navigate a narrow tunnel surrounded by several deep hip rotator muscles.

This diagnostic evolution is important because treatment approaches differ significantly. Rather than focusing solely on the piriformis muscle, effective management requires a comprehensive assessment of the entire deep gluteal space, movement patterns, and the function of all the muscles that could contribute to nerve compression. The concept of piriformis syndrome as an isolated condition is being replaced by the broader, more accurate understanding of Deep Gluteal Syndrome.`,

  'adductor-related-groin-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Adductor-related groin pain is the classic "groin pull" story, but it's often more complex than a single event. The biggest misconception is that this is "just a muscle strain" that will heal with a bit of rest and ice. While that might be true for a very minor, first-time strain, recurrent or persistent groin pain is rarely that simple. It's often a sign of an underlying imbalance. The adductor muscles don't just pull your leg inwards; they play a critical role in stabilizing the pelvis. Chronic adductor issues are frequently a symptom of a broader problem, such as weakness in the abdominal muscles, glutes, or a lack of core control.

The adductors are a crucial link in the kinetic chain that transfers force from the legs to the trunk. When an athlete pushes off to skate or cut, the adductors on the stance leg work in concert with the gluteus medius and the obliques to stabilize the pelvis over the leg. If any part of that system is weak (for example, the obliques on the opposite side), the adductors may be forced to take on an excessive amount of stabilizing work, leading to overload and injury.

After a painful groin injury, it's common for athletes to develop a fear of re-injury. They may start to move tentatively, avoiding the powerful, explosive movements their sport requires. This can lead to protective muscle guarding, where the body subconsciously tenses the adductors and other surrounding muscles. This guarding pattern can actually alter movement mechanics and increase the risk of another injury.`,

    clinicalPresentation: {
      primarySymptoms: [
        "Pain in upper inner thigh - usually felt high in groin, close to pubic bone, ranging from dull ache to very sharp, intense pain",
        "Tenderness to touch - adductor longus tendon where it attaches to bone is often very tender to press on",
        "Pain with specific movements - key triggers include sprinting, cutting, kicking, or any movement involving forcefully bringing legs together (adduction)",
        "Pain with 'squeezing' - actively squeezing knees together against resistance will often reproduce the pain",
        "Morning ache and stiffness in groin area upon waking"
      ],
      associatedSymptoms: [
        "Sharp twinge in inner thigh during powerful crossover stride or cut",
        "Pain when striking ball with inside of foot",
        "Sometimes initial memorable 'pop' or tearing sensation",
        "Pain that builds over time, becoming progressively more limiting",
        "Feels fine when walking, but sharp pain with push off, sprint, or change direction",
        "Core weakness or poor pelvic control"
      ],
      typicalPattern: "Classic story is hockey player who feels sharp twinge in their inner thigh during powerful crossover stride, or soccer player who feels it when they plant foot and cut hard to change direction, or when they strike ball with inside of foot. Pain is located high up in groin, right where inner thigh muscles attach to pubic bone. Often more complex than single event - pain that builds over time, becoming progressively more limiting."

      firstVisit: "When an athlete comes to me with groin pain, my first goal is to clarify the diagnosis. Groin pain is notoriously complex area with many potential sources. I'll ask you to point with one finger to exact spot of maximal pain. I'll ask about mechanism of injury: was it single event or did it build up over time? What specific movements in your sport are most provocative? Have you had this before? A history of recurrent groin strains points strongly towards unaddressed underlying stability issue. My systematic exam includes: careful palpation of groin structures starting away from painful area, squeeze test (squeezing my fist or ball between your knees), adductor muscle length and strength assessment, and importantly - thorough assessment of surrounding muscles including abdominals and gluteals.",
      earlyPhase: "First step is to reduce activities that cause sharp pain - this doesn't mean complete rest. We start with pain-free strengthening, focusing on isometric exercises. The early stages focus heavily on motor control, re-establishing the brain-muscle connection before we start adding heavy loads.",
      progression: "Look beyond the site of pain. We must restore balance of strength and control across entire pelvis and core. Program begins with calming sensitive tissue and progresses systematically to build foundation of strength, and finally, to restore dynamic, high-speed stability required for sport. 8-12 weeks typically required, sometimes longer. Rushing process is most common reason for re-injury."

  'shoulder-impingement': {
    pathophysiology: `Shoulder impingement (subacromial pain syndrome) involves irritation of the rotator cuff tendons and bursa in the subacromial space. Despite the name, it's now understood as more than just mechanical compression. The tendons develop degenerative changes and the bursa becomes thickened, not from simple pinching but from a complex interaction of factors.

Modern understanding shifts away from blaming the shape of your acromion (the 'hooked' acromion seen on X-rays is common in pain-free shoulders too). Instead, we focus on functional problems: how your shoulder blade moves, rotator cuff strength, and posture all play crucial roles. Shoulder impingement frequently coexists with rotator cuff injuries, as both conditions share similar underlying biomechanical issues. In some cases, untreated impingement may contribute to the development of shoulder bursitis, and chronic impingement can lead to compensatory patterns that contribute to frozen shoulder.`,

    biomechanics: `Most shoulder impingement is 'secondary' or functional, meaning it's caused by movement problems rather than bone shape. Key contributors include weak or fatigued rotator cuff muscles, imbalanced scapular stabilizers (typically tight upper traps and pectoralis minor with weak serratus anterior and lower traps), and posterior capsule tightness.

In overhead athletes, the kinetic chain matters enormously. Any weakness from the legs and core forces the shoulder to overwork. Poor hip stability or core strength means your shoulder compensates to generate power, leading to fatigue and eventual breakdown. This is why I assess your whole body, not just your shoulder.

Common aggravating factors include the 'boom-bust' cycle of overdoing on good days, specific movements like overhead reaching or reaching behind, sleeping on the affected shoulder, and periods of increased stress which heighten muscle tension and pain sensitivity.`,

  // Placeholder entries for conditions under development
  'knee-pain-patellofemoral': {
    pathophysiology: `Patellofemoral pain syndrome involves dysfunction at the interface where your kneecap (patella) meets your thigh bone (femur). The condition typically develops when your patella doesn't track properly in its groove during knee movement, creating abnormal pressure and stress on the joint cartilage.

The patella normally glides smoothly in the trochlear groove of the femur, but when muscle imbalances or structural factors alter this tracking, certain areas of cartilage experience increased compression. This can lead to irritation of pain-sensitive structures including the joint capsule, synovium, and subchondral bone.

Research shows that people with patellofemoral pain often have altered biomechanics during functional activities, with changes in how forces are distributed across the joint during weight-bearing movements like squatting, stair climbing, and landing from jumps.`,

    biomechanics: `Your patella acts like a pulley to increase the mechanical advantage of your quadriceps muscles. When this system isn't working optimally, several biomechanical factors contribute to the problem.

Hip weakness, particularly in the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus, often allows your thigh to collapse inward during activities. This creates a valgus angle at the knee that pulls your patella laterally, increasing stress on the lateral facet.

Quadriceps imbalances, especially weakness in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) relative to the vastus lateralis, can contribute to poor patellar tracking. The VMO is crucial for pulling the patella medially and preventing lateral drift.

Your foot mechanics also play a role - excessive pronation can create internal rotation of the tibia, which alters the angle of pull from your quadriceps and affects patellar tracking. Tight structures like the iliotibial band, lateral retinaculum, or hip flexors can create additional forces that pull the patella out of optimal alignment.`,

  'degenerative-disc-disease': {
    pathophysiology: `Degenerative disc disease represents the natural aging process of your intervertebral discs, though it can occur prematurely due to various factors. Your discs are composed of an outer fibrous ring (annulus fibrosus) and an inner gel-like core (nucleus pulposus) that normally acts as a shock absorber between vertebrae.

As discs age, they lose water content and the nucleus pulposus becomes less gel-like, reducing the disc's ability to distribute loads evenly. This dehydration process leads to decreased disc height and can result in small tears in the annulus fibrosus. When the disc loses height, it alters the biomechanics of the entire spinal segment.

The facet joints, which normally share load with the discs, begin to bear a greater proportion of the forces passing through that level of the spine. This can lead to accelerated wear of these joints and may contribute to the development of bone spurs and other arthritic changes. Despite the name, degenerative disc disease isn't truly a disease but rather a description of the structural changes that occur over time.

It's important to understand that these structural changes don't always predict pain levels - many people have significant disc degeneration visible on imaging scans but experience no symptoms whatsoever. Conversely, some individuals with minimal structural changes may have considerable pain. This disconnect between imaging findings and symptoms highlights why treatment focuses on function and symptoms rather than structural abnormalities.`,

    biomechanics: `Your spine functions as an integrated system where each level works with adjacent levels to allow movement while maintaining stability. When disc degeneration occurs, this system becomes altered in ways that can contribute to symptoms.

The disc and two facet joints at each level form what we call the three-joint complex. Normally, the disc bears approximately 80% of the compressive load, while the facet joints guide movement and prevent excessive rotation. When disc height decreases due to degeneration, the facet joints begin to bear more load than they're designed for - sometimes up to 50% of the total force.

This increased load on the facet joints can lead to inflammation and pain. Additionally, loss of disc height can narrow the spaces where nerve roots exit the spine, potentially causing nerve-related symptoms. The supporting muscles often respond to these changes by increasing tension to provide additional stability, which can contribute to muscle-related pain and stiffness.`,

  'spinal-stenosis': {
    pathophysiology: `Spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spaces within your spinal canal, creating compression of neural structures. This narrowing can occur in the central canal (central stenosis) where the spinal cord or cauda equina travels, or in the lateral recesses and foramina where individual nerve roots exit.

The narrowing typically develops gradually through multiple mechanisms. Degenerative changes in the discs can cause bulging into the spinal canal, while arthritis of the facet joints leads to bone spur formation and joint enlargement. The ligamentum flavum, which runs along the back of the spinal canal, can thicken and buckle inward, further reducing available space.

As these structures encroach on the neural space, they create a mismatch between the space available and the space needed for optimal neural function. The compression may be positional - worsening when your spine is extended and improving with flexion, which explains why many people find relief when leaning forward or sitting.`,

    biomechanics: `Your spine's position significantly affects the amount of space available within the spinal canal. When you extend your back or stand upright, the canal diameter decreases due to buckling of the ligamentum flavum and narrowing of the lateral recesses. This positioning can worsen compression of already compromised neural structures.

Flexing your spine has the opposite effect - it increases canal dimensions by stretching the ligamentum flavum and opening up the lateral recesses. This is why many people with spinal stenosis naturally adopt a slightly flexed posture when walking or find relief when leaning on a shopping cart.

Walking on an incline often feels easier than walking on flat ground because the incline naturally puts you in a slightly flexed position. Similarly, cycling is usually tolerated better than walking because the cycling position maintains spinal flexion while allowing cardiovascular exercise.`,

  'postural-dysfunction': {
    pathophysiology: `Postural dysfunction, particularly upper crossed syndrome, develops from prolonged positioning that creates predictable patterns of muscle imbalance. When you maintain positions like forward head posture or rounded shoulders for extended periods, certain muscles adapt by shortening while others become lengthened and weakened.

The muscles that commonly become tight and overactive include the upper trapezius, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoral muscles. Meanwhile, the deep cervical flexors, middle and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior become weakened and underactive. This creates a characteristic "crossed" pattern of imbalances.

These imbalances create joint dysfunction, particularly at the upper cervical spine, mid-cervical region, cervicothoracic junction, and thoracic spine. The altered biomechanics place increased stress on joint surfaces and can lead to pain, stiffness, and eventually degenerative changes if left unaddressed. The nervous system also adapts to these patterns, making them feel "normal" even when they're mechanically inefficient.`,

    biomechanics: `Modern lifestyle factors create the perfect storm for postural dysfunction. Prolonged computer work, smartphone use, and desk-based activities all encourage forward head posture and rounded shoulders. When your head moves forward just 2-3 inches from its optimal position, the load on your cervical spine can increase by 2-3 times.

Your thoracic spine responds to forward head posture by increasing its kyphotic curve, which places additional stress on the thoracic vertebrae and can contribute to compression fractures over time. The scapulae wing outward and elevate, changing the mechanics of shoulder movement and potentially leading to impingement syndromes.

The deeper stabilizing muscles of your neck - the deep cervical flexors - become inhibited in this posture, while the superficial muscles like the upper trapezius work overtime to support your head's weight. This creates tension patterns that can contribute to headaches, neck pain, and shoulder dysfunction.`,

  'headaches-migraines': {
    pathophysiology: `Cervicogenic headaches originate from dysfunction in your upper cervical spine and associated musculature. Unlike primary headaches (migraines or tension-type), these headaches are caused by problems in your neck that refer pain to your head through complex neural pathways.

The trigeminocervical nucleus in your brainstem receives input from both your trigeminal nerve (which supplies your head and face) and the upper cervical nerves (C1-C3). This convergence means that dysfunction in your neck can create headache pain that feels identical to other headache types.

Common cervical contributors include upper cervical joint restrictions, particularly at the C1-C2 segment, muscle imbalances in the suboccipital muscles, and altered biomechanics from forward head posture. The greater occipital nerve, which emerges between C1 and C2, often becomes sensitized when these structures are dysfunctional.

While true migraines have a neurological basis involving brain chemistry changes, many people with "migraine" symptoms actually have cervicogenic headaches that respond well to musculoskeletal treatment.`,

    biomechanics: `Your upper cervical spine has unique biomechanics that make it vulnerable to dysfunction. The atlantooccipital joint (C0-C1) provides primarily flexion and extension, while the atlantoaxial joint (C1-C2) allows for approximately 50% of your neck's rotation.

When these joints lose their normal mobility patterns, compensation occurs throughout the cervical spine. Forward head posture, common in our digital age, places the upper cervical spine in extension while the lower cervical spine moves into flexion. This creates increased tension in the suboccipital muscles and altered load distribution across the upper cervical joints.

The deep neck flexors (longus capitis and longus colli) often become inhibited, while superficial muscles like the upper trapezius and levator scapulae become overactive. This muscle imbalance pattern can create trigger points that refer pain to the head in characteristic patterns - suboccipital trigger points often refer to the forehead and temple areas.

Poor scapular positioning affects cervical mechanics by altering the base of support for neck muscles. When your shoulder blades are protracted and elevated, it changes the length-tension relationships of muscles that attach to both the scapula and the cervical spine.`,

  'shoulder-instability': {
    pathophysiology: `Shoulder instability occurs when the structures that normally keep your shoulder joint stable are compromised, allowing excessive movement or displacement of the humeral head within the glenoid socket. Your shoulder joint sacrifices stability for mobility, making it inherently vulnerable to instability.

The stability of your shoulder depends on both static restraints (joint capsule, ligaments, labrum, and bony architecture) and dynamic restraints (muscle activation patterns and proprioceptive feedback). When these systems fail, your shoulder may sublux (partially dislocate) or fully dislocate.

Atraumatic instability typically develops gradually due to repetitive microtrauma, generalized ligamentous laxity, or muscle imbalances. This type often affects multiple directions and responds well to conservative treatment. Traumatic instability usually results from a specific injury that damages static restraints, most commonly anterior dislocations that tear the anterior capsule and labrum.

The neuromuscular system plays a crucial role in dynamic stabilization. When proprioceptive feedback is impaired or muscle activation patterns are altered, your shoulder may feel unstable even without structural damage.`,

    biomechanics: `Your shoulder's stability depends on the coordinated function of multiple muscle groups working together. The rotator cuff muscles provide dynamic compression and centering of the humeral head, while larger muscles like the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major generate power for movement.

Scapular positioning and movement are critical for shoulder stability. Your scapula must provide a stable platform for the glenohumeral joint while allowing for coordinated movement during arm elevation. When scapular dyskinesis occurs, it alters the mechanics of the entire shoulder complex and can contribute to instability.

In multidirectional instability, the joint capsule is often enlarged, allowing excessive translation in multiple directions. This creates a mechanical disadvantage for the dynamic stabilizers and requires enhanced neuromuscular control to maintain joint stability during functional activities.

The kinetic chain from your feet to your fingertips influences shoulder stability. Poor core stability, hip weakness, or altered movement patterns can create compensatory stresses that contribute to shoulder instability, particularly in overhead athletes.`,

  'shoulder-bursitis': {
    pathophysiology: `Shoulder bursitis, specifically subacromial bursitis, involves inflammation of the small fluid-filled sac (bursa) that sits between your rotator cuff tendons and the bony roof of your shoulder (acromion). This bursa normally allows smooth gliding of the rotator cuff tendons beneath the acromion during arm movement.

When the subacromial space becomes narrowed due to bone spurs, poor posture, muscle imbalances, or repetitive overhead activities, the bursa becomes compressed and irritated. This compression leads to inflammation, thickening of the bursa walls, and production of excess synovial fluid, creating a cycle of swelling and further compression.

The condition often coexists with rotator cuff tendinopathy and shoulder impingement syndrome, as they share similar mechanical causes. The inflamed bursa can contribute to pain and dysfunction, but it's usually a secondary problem rather than the primary issue. Understanding this relationship is crucial because treating only the bursitis without addressing underlying mechanical problems often leads to recurrence.

Acute bursitis may result from direct trauma or sudden overuse, while chronic bursitis typically develops gradually from repetitive microtrauma and sustained mechanical irritation.`,

    biomechanics: `The subacromial space is a narrow area between your humeral head and the undersurface of the acromion. During arm elevation, this space normally maintains about 6-14mm of clearance, but various factors can reduce this critical space.

Poor scapular mechanics significantly contribute to subacromial crowding. When your scapula doesn't rotate properly during arm elevation, it fails to maintain optimal clearance between the acromion and the underlying structures. This is often seen with weakness in the serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscles.

Forward head posture and rounded shoulders, common in our computer-based society, alter the orientation of the acromion and reduce subacromial space. This postural pattern also changes the resting length and activation patterns of the rotator cuff muscles, making them less effective at maintaining proper humeral head position.

Rotator cuff weakness, particularly in the posterior and inferior aspects, allows superior migration of the humeral head during arm elevation. This upward translation narrows the subacromial space and increases compression forces on the bursa and surrounding structures.`,

  'wrist-sprains': {
    pathophysiology: `Wrist sprains involve damage to the ligaments that connect the bones of your wrist, most commonly affecting the scapholunate ligament complex or the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). These structures are crucial for maintaining proper carpal bone alignment and allowing coordinated wrist movement.

The scapholunate interosseous ligament is particularly vulnerable to injury during falls on an outstretched hand or rotational movements under load. When this ligament is damaged, it can lead to abnormal movement patterns between the scaphoid and lunate bones, potentially causing long-term instability if not properly managed.

TFCC injuries affect the complex of ligaments and cartilage on the pinky side of your wrist. This structure acts as a shock absorber and stabilizer for the distal radioulnar joint, allowing smooth rotation of your forearm while maintaining wrist stability.

The healing potential of wrist ligaments varies significantly depending on their blood supply. Some areas have excellent healing capacity, while others, particularly the central portions of certain ligaments, have limited blood flow and may heal slowly or incompletely without proper treatment.`,

    biomechanics: `Your wrist functions as a complex joint system where eight small carpal bones must work together to provide both stability and mobility. The scapholunate ligament acts as a critical link that maintains the relationship between the scaphoid and lunate during all wrist movements.

During normal wrist extension, the scaphoid tends to flex while the lunate extends, creating a complex motion that requires intact ligamentous restraints. When the scapholunate ligament is injured, this coordinated movement is disrupted, leading to altered mechanics and potential for progressive instability.

The dart throwing motion (DTM) represents a path of movement where the wrist moves from radial extension to ulnar flexion, following the natural alignment of the carpal bones. This movement pattern places less stress on the scapholunate interval and is often used therapeutically in rehabilitation programs.

TFCC injuries affect the biomechanics of forearm rotation and ulnar-sided wrist stability. The complex must maintain proper relationship between the radius, ulna, and carpal bones during activities that involve gripping combined with rotation, such as using a screwdriver or opening jars.`,

  'repetitive-strain-injuries': {
    pathophysiology: `Repetitive strain injuries (RSI) develop when tissues are subjected to repeated low-level stress over extended periods, exceeding their capacity to recover between episodes of use. This creates a cycle of microtrauma and incomplete healing that gradually leads to tissue breakdown and sensitization of pain pathways.

The pathophysiology involves multiple systems: musculoskeletal tissues experience microscopic damage from repetitive loading, while the nervous system becomes increasingly sensitive to normal stimuli. This process, called peripheral and central sensitization, means that activities which were once painless now trigger significant discomfort.

Computer-related RSI typically affects the upper limbs through sustained postures combined with repetitive small movements. The muscles that stabilize your shoulder blade, neck, and forearm work continuously to maintain positions required for keyboard and mouse use, leading to fatigue and eventual breakdown of normal tissue architecture.

Psychological factors play a significant role in RSI development and persistence. Work stress, time pressure, and fear of job security can increase muscle tension and delay recovery. The condition often becomes a complex interaction between physical tissue changes and psychological stress responses.`,

    biomechanics: `Modern computer work creates the perfect biomechanical storm for RSI development. Your shoulder blade muscles must work continuously to stabilize your arm in space while small intrinsic muscles perform thousands of precise finger movements each day.

Forward head posture, common during computer use, places your cervical spine in extension while loading the upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles excessively. This altered posture changes the mechanics of your entire upper limb, affecting how forces are transmitted from your neck to your fingertips.

Static muscle contractions required for sustained postures reduce blood flow to working muscles, limiting oxygen and nutrient delivery while allowing waste products to accumulate. This metabolic stress contributes to muscle fatigue and the development of trigger points that can refer pain throughout the upper extremity.

The repetitive nature of typing and mouse use creates cumulative loading on tendons and ligaments that may exceed their adaptive capacity. Small movements repeated thousands of times can cause more tissue damage than larger movements performed less frequently, particularly when combined with poor posture and inadequate recovery time.`,

  'si-joint-dysfunction': {
    pathophysiology: `Sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction involves abnormal movement or positioning of the joint between your sacrum and ilium bones. This joint normally allows only small amounts of movement (2-4mm translation and 2-4 degrees rotation) but plays a crucial role in transferring forces between your spine and lower extremities.

The SI joint is surrounded by some of the strongest ligaments in the body, which can become either too loose (hypermobile) or too tight (hypomobile), both of which can cause pain and dysfunction. The joint surfaces are irregular and interlocking, designed more for stability than mobility, which makes them vulnerable to dysfunction when normal mechanics are disturbed.

Muscle imbalances around the pelvis significantly contribute to SI joint problems. When muscles like the deep abdominals, multifidus, gluteus maximus, or latissimus dorsi don't function properly, it alters the force distribution across the joint and can lead to compensatory stress patterns.

The joint is richly innervated with pain receptors, which explains why SI dysfunction can be extremely painful. The pain pattern often involves the posterior pelvis but can refer to the groin, hip, thigh, and even down to the foot, making diagnosis challenging.`,

    biomechanics: `Your SI joint functions as part of the closed kinetic chain that includes your lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip joints. During walking, the SI joint must allow small rotational movements while maintaining stability to transfer forces effectively from your legs to your spine.

The joint's movement pattern is complex and involves nutation (sacrum tilting forward) and counter-nutation (sacrum tilting backward) that must be coordinated with hip and spine movement. When this coordination is disrupted, abnormal stresses develop that can lead to joint irritation and surrounding muscle guarding.

Form closure refers to the passive stability provided by the joint's bony architecture and ligaments, while force closure describes the active stability created by muscle activation. Problems can develop in either system, but force closure dysfunction is more common and typically responds well to physiotherapy intervention.

The posterior oblique sling (latissimus dorsi and opposite gluteus maximus connected through the thoracolumbar fascia) and anterior oblique sling (internal oblique and opposite adductor muscles) are crucial muscle chains that provide dynamic stability to the SI joint during functional activities.`,

  'pcl-injuries': {
    pathophysiology: `Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries involve damage to the ligament that prevents excessive backward movement of your tibia relative to your femur. The PCL is the strongest ligament in your knee and has a better blood supply than the ACL, giving it superior healing potential when injured.

PCL injuries are graded from I to III based on severity: Grade I involves stretching with microscopic tears, Grade II involves partial tearing with some functional loss, and Grade III represents complete rupture. Unlike ACL injuries, isolated PCL tears have an excellent capacity for healing due to their rich vascular supply.

The mechanism of injury typically involves a posteriorly directed force on the proximal tibia, such as falling onto a bent knee or dashboard injuries in motor vehicle accidents. Sports injuries often occur during hyperflexion or hyperextension movements, particularly in contact sports.

The PCL works in conjunction with other knee structures to provide stability. When injured, the quadriceps muscle becomes crucial as it can partially compensate for PCL function by preventing excessive posterior tibial translation during functional activities.`,

    biomechanics: `Your PCL serves as the primary restraint against posterior translation of the tibia, particularly when your knee is flexed beyond 30 degrees. Unlike the ACL, which is tight in extension, the PCL becomes increasingly tight as the knee flexes, with maximum tension occurring at 90 degrees of flexion.

The quadriceps muscle group, particularly the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis, can provide some functional replacement for a damaged PCL by preventing the femur from sliding forward on the tibia. This is why quadriceps strengthening is the cornerstone of PCL rehabilitation.

During normal gait, the PCL experiences loads of 0.5-1 times body weight, but during activities like squatting or climbing stairs, these forces can increase to 2-3 times body weight. Understanding these loading patterns is crucial for designing appropriate rehabilitation programs.

The posterior drawer test demonstrates the primary dysfunction in PCL injuries - when you sit with your knee bent and someone pushes your shin backward, there's excessive movement compared to the uninjured side. However, this instability may not translate to significant functional problems in daily activities.`,

  'peroneal-tendinopathy': {
    pathophysiology: `Peroneal tendinopathy affects the fibularis longus and brevis tendons that run behind your lateral malleolus (outer ankle bone). These tendons are crucial for ankle stability, particularly during walking on uneven surfaces, and help prevent ankle sprains by providing lateral stability.

The peroneal tendons are subject to significant mechanical stress as they navigate around the sharp posterior edge of the fibula, held in place by the superior peroneal retinaculum. This anatomical arrangement makes them vulnerable to friction and degenerative changes, particularly when the retinaculum is damaged or when there are underlying biomechanical issues.

Tendinopathy develops when the cumulative load on these tendons exceeds their adaptive capacity. This leads to a failed healing response characterized by disorganized collagen, increased ground substance, and neovascularization. The result is a painful, thickened tendon with reduced mechanical properties.

The condition often develops in conjunction with chronic ankle instability, where recurrent ankle sprains lead to peroneal muscle weakness and altered biomechanics. This creates a cycle where weak peroneals increase ankle instability, leading to further tendon stress and degeneration.`,

    biomechanics: `Your peroneal muscles serve dual roles as foot everters and ankle lateral stabilizers. The fibularis longus also supports your medial longitudinal arch, while the fibularis brevis provides dynamic stability against ankle inversion.

During the stance phase of walking, your peroneal muscles work eccentrically to control inversion and provide lateral stability. On uneven surfaces or during cutting movements in sports, these demands increase dramatically, making the tendons vulnerable to overuse injury.

The peroneal tendons must navigate a sharp turn around the lateral malleolus, similar to a rope moving around a pulley. This creates high friction forces, especially when ankle motion increases or when there are anatomical variations like a prominent peroneal tubercle.

When ankle proprioception is impaired following sprains, the peroneal muscles must work harder to provide conscious and subconscious stability. This increased demand, combined with potential weakness from previous injuries, creates the perfect environment for tendinopathy development.`,

    clinicalPresentation: {
      primarySymptoms: [
        "Pain along the outer aspect of the ankle, particularly behind and below the lateral malleolus",
        "Pain that worsens with activity, especially walking on uneven surfaces or pushing off during running",
        "Tenderness with direct pressure over the peroneal tendons",
        "Pain with resisted eversion (turning foot outward) of the ankle",
        "Stiffness and pain after periods of rest, particularly in the morning"
      ],
      associatedSymptoms: [
        "Swelling along the tendon pathway",
        "Sensation of ankle instability or 'giving way'",
        "Difficulty with single-leg standing or balance activities",
        "Compensatory movement patterns in the hip or knee",
        "History of recurrent ankle sprains"
      ],
      typicalPattern: "I typically see patients with a history of ankle sprains who develop gradual onset lateral ankle pain. Many describe difficulty with activities like hiking on trails or sports requiring quick direction changes. The pain often improves with rest but returns quickly when activity resumes."
