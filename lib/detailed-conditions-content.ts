  'low-back-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Mechanical low back pain typically involves dysfunction of the intervertebral discs, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or surrounding musculature. The disc starts to lose its hydration and load distribution capabilities, which leads to increased stress on surrounding structures.

The deep stabilizing muscles like multifidus and transverse abdominis often show delayed activation patterns, compromising segmental stability. Over time, this can lead to movement pattern changes that perpetuate the problem.

When pain persists beyond 3 months, changes in the nervous system can amplify pain perception, making previously non-painful movements uncomfortable.`,

  'hip-osteoarthritis': {
    pathophysiology: `Hip osteoarthritis is a dynamic process involving the entire joint structure, not simple "wear and tear." The most pervasive and damaging misconception about OA is that it's a simple "wear and tear" disease where the joint is worn out and nothing can be done. This is not the full picture. OA is a dynamic process involving the entire joint structure, and it does not mean your active life is over. It begins with articular cartilage breakdown (the smooth, white, slippery tissue covering bone ends), followed by subchondral bone changes, osteophyte formation ("bone spurs" - bony lumps growing in response to inflammation), and joint space narrowing. The process involves inflammatory mediators, altered biomechanics, and compensatory muscle weakness. Critically, pain is not directly proportional to radiographic changes - I have seen countless patients with "severe" OA on imaging who have minimal pain and excellent function, and vice versa. Your experience of pain is real, but it is not solely dictated by what an X-ray shows. 

The hip joint doesn't exist in isolation - when it becomes stiff and painful from OA, the body makes compensations. The most common is increased movement and strain on the lumbar spine and sacroiliac (SI) joint, which is why so many people with hip OA also develop low back pain. The knee can also take a hit - a stiff hip changes the way you walk, altering forces that travel down through the knee and ankle. Living with persistent pain is exhausting and can lead to fear of movement, anxiety, and feeling of fragility. This is where pain centralization comes in - over time, the nervous system can become sensitized, essentially "turning up the volume" on pain signals. Gentle, graded movement can help recalibrate the nervous system.`,

I want to know about the 24-hour pattern - pain worse at the end of the day suggests a load-related issue, while severe night pain could flag other, more inflammatory conditions. The most important question is: 'What can't you do anymore that you wish you could?' This becomes our true north for goal setting. On the examination table, I'll assess limited internal rotation (often one of the first and most significant motion limitations in hip OA), test pain with passive motion (FADIR test), and assess muscle strength deficits, particularly the gluteus medius and maximus which are crucial for shock absorption and stability. We'll discuss the load-capacity model - explaining that pain occurs when the load on your hip exceeds its current capacity to handle that load.",

  'femoroacetabular-impingement': {
    pathophysiology: `Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) syndrome involves abnormal contact between the femoral neck and acetabular rim during hip movement, specifically during deep hip flexion and internal rotation. The biggest misconception is that having a certain hip shape (a "cam" or "pincer" morphology on an X-ray) automatically means you will have pain - this is false. Many elite athletes and pain-free individuals have these shapes. FAI is a syndrome, which means it's the combination of a specific hip shape plus symptoms plus clinical signs. The shape itself is not the problem; the problem is how you are loading that shape.

Two main types exist: CAM (extra bone on femoral head-neck junction creating a "bump" that makes contact with the socket during deep flexion) and PINCER (deep acetabular socket where the socket is too deep, causing the rim to contact the femoral neck). Mixed types with both morphologies are common. The cam shape can make contact with the socket and labrum (cartilaginous ring around the socket) during deep hip flexion, leading to a pinching sensation and potential stress on the labrum.

To avoid the pinching sensation, the body develops clever compensation strategies. A common one is to create extra movement through the low back and pelvis - instead of flexing at the hip to squat, a person might excessively round their lumbar spine (butt-winking). Over time, this can lead to low back pain. Similarly, a stiff and painful hip can cause the knee to collapse inwards during activities like running or landing, potentially contributing to knee pain.

When a specific movement consistently causes sharp pain, the brain learns to fear and avoid it. This leads to protective muscle guarding, where muscles around the hip (like hip flexors and adductors) become chronically tense in anticipation of pain. This tension can then become a secondary source of pain itself.`,

These activities all involve sustained or repeated deep hip flexion, which can be provocative. I'll ask you to show me the exact movement that brings on the pain - this functional demonstration is often more revealing than any specific test. The hallmark test is the FADIR test (bringing knee towards chest and across body while rotating hip inwards) - this is highly sensitive, meaning if it's negative, it's less likely to be FAI. I'll carefully measure your hip's internal and external rotation, looking for significant loss of internal rotation compared to the other side. I'll also look for patterns of overactive and underactive muscles - often the hip flexors are tight and dominant, while the deep gluteal muscles are weak and inhibited.",

      progression: "Progressive strengthening focusing on posterior chain (glutes and hamstrings) to balance out often-dominant anterior hip muscles, while respecting your hip's unique anatomy. By strengthening the deep hip muscles, particularly the gluteal group, we can improve the way the femoral head sits and moves within the socket, creating better control and dynamic stability.

  'greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS), previously called "trochanteric bursitis," is primarily a gluteal tendinopathy affecting the gluteus medius and minimus tendons at their insertion on the greater trochanter. For years, this condition was called "trochanteric bursitis," and the presumed treatment was rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory injections. We now understand this is often incorrect. Research has shown that the primary issue is frequently not an inflamed bursa, but a distressed gluteus medius or minimus tendon - a gluteal tendinopathy. The bursa can become secondarily irritated, but it's rarely the main driver. This changes everything. Treating a tendinopathy is not about rest; it's about managing load and progressively strengthening the tendon. The idea that you just need to "rest it" is perhaps the most unhelpful advice for this condition.

The condition involves a load-capacity imbalance where compressive forces (from positions that bring the IT band across the trochanter) and tensile loads exceed the tendon's ability to adapt. Postures that bring your thigh across the midline of your body can cause the iliotibial (IT) band to compress the gluteal tendons against the hip bone, a key source of irritation in GTPS.

Weakness in the gluteus medius and minimus doesn't just cause local pain; it degrades movement quality throughout the kinetic chain. When these muscles aren't doing their job of stabilizing the pelvis, you can develop a "hip drop" or Trendelenburg gait pattern. This leads to compensations everywhere: the tensor fascia latae (TFL) and IT band may become overworked and tight, the low back can be subjected to shearing forces, and the knee can collapse inwards (valgus), potentially contributing to patellofemoral pain.

Chronic tendon pain is frustrating because the pain is often worse with rest (like at night), creating a cycle of anxiety and poor sleep. Poor sleep, in turn, is known to increase pain sensitivity.`,

    clinicalPresentation: {
      primarySymptoms: [
        "Localized, tender, aching pain centered over the bony point on side of hip (greater trochanter)",
        "Pain radiating down the outer thigh, sometimes as far as the knee",
        "Severe night pain - hallmark symptom. Direct pressure of lying on affected side, or stretch from lying on opposite side can be highly irritating",
        "Start-up pain when getting out of bed or chair after being still (sometimes called 'start-up' pain)",
        "Pain with single-leg weight bearing activities and walking (especially up hills or uneven ground)"
      ],
      associatedSymptoms: [
        "Pain with climbing stairs and standing on one leg",
        "Difficulty lying on either side - 'I just can't get comfortable'",
        "Trendelenburg gait or hip drop during walking",
        "Pain with crossing legs or prolonged standing on one hip",
        "Simple actions like getting out of car, climbing stairs, or standing up after sitting become potent triggers"
      ],
      typicalPattern: "Patient with GTPS typically points directly to side of their hip - the bony part you can feel, known as the greater trochanter. The story is rarely about a specific injury. Instead, it's about a pain that has crept in and become a persistent, nagging ache. Most common and frustrating complaint is night pain. Common in post-menopausal women but affects all ages. Insidious onset often linked to increase in load (new exercise program, prolonged standing, poor sleep surface)."

    evidenceSnapshot: {
      firstLine: "Education and progressive loading exercise program superior to corticosteroid injection",
      imaging: "Usually clinical diagnosis; ultrasound or MRI can confirm tendinopathy if needed",
      management: "Load management focusing on compression avoidance, progressive tendon strengthening",
      sources: "2018 LEAP Trial (BMJ); Gluteal Tendinopathy Clinical Guidelines"
    },

    whatToExpect: {
      firstVisit: "The subjective history is paramount for GTPS. The story of pain with side-lying is a huge clue. I'll dig deeper: 'When you lie on your good side, where exactly do you put your top leg?' Most people will say they just let it fall forward, which puts the hip into a position of adduction and flexion, compressing the tendons. I'll ask about exercise habits - have you recently started a new running program or 'boot camp' class with lots of single-leg work? A sudden, unaccustomed spike in load is a classic trigger. Your age and hormonal status are also relevant, as GTPS is particularly common in post-menopausal women. My physical exam includes: direct, precise palpation over the greater trochanter (significant tenderness is a key sign), single-leg stance test (standing on affected leg for 30 seconds often reproduces lateral hip pain), and resisted strength tests for hip abductors. I may also use de-loading tests - testing abductor strength with the hip in a slightly abducted position often reduces compressive force and can be less painful.",
      earlyPhase: "Focus entirely on stopping compressive loads while beginning non-compressive strengthening exercises. Your number one job is to avoid postures and movements that compress the gluteal tendons against the greater trochanter. This means no crossing your legs, no 'hanging' on one hip when you stand, and meticulous attention to your sleeping position. Sleep modification is crucial - use pillows between knees and ankles to maintain neutral hip alignment.",
      progression: "Our philosophy is simple: calm the tendon down, then build it up. Gradual progression from isometric exercises (which can have pain-relieving effect) to functional strengthening, slowly building tendon capacity while respecting tissue sensitivity. Tendon healing is a slow biological process - consistency is far more important than intensity."

  'hip-labral-tears': {
    pathophysiology: `Hip labral tears involve damage to the fibrocartilaginous ring (labrum) that deepens the acetabular socket and helps stabilize the hip joint. The labrum provides a suction seal that maintains negative pressure within the joint, contributing significantly to hip stability. When torn, this can result in mechanical symptoms and altered joint biomechanics. Labral tears often occur in conjunction with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), where abnormal bone contact repeatedly stresses the labral tissue during hip movement. However, not all labral tears are symptomatic - many people have labral tears without pain. The development of symptoms depends on the tear's location, size, and the individual's activity demands.`,

  'hip-bursitis': {
    pathophysiology: `Hip bursitis involves inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion the hip joint. The most commonly affected bursae are the trochanteric bursa (lateral hip) and iliopsoas bursa (anterior hip). However, true isolated bursitis is actually less common than previously thought. What was traditionally called "trochanteric bursitis" is now understood to be primarily gluteal tendinopathy. True bursitis typically occurs secondary to other conditions, trauma, or infection. The bursa becomes inflamed due to mechanical irritation, repetitive friction, or in rare cases, infection or inflammatory conditions.`,

  'deep-gluteal-syndrome': {
    pathophysiology: `Deep gluteal syndrome encompasses a group of conditions causing sciatic nerve entrapment in the deep gluteal space. The sciatic nerve travels through the piriformis muscle or between the piriformis and other deep rotators, where it can become compressed or irritated. This can occur due to piriformis muscle spasm, anatomical variations, scar tissue, or other space-occupying lesions. The syndrome is often misdiagnosed as lumbar radiculopathy, but differs in that the nerve compression occurs in the gluteal region rather than at the spine. Understanding this distinction is crucial for appropriate treatment, as spinal treatments may not address the true source of symptoms.`,

  'proximal-hamstring-tendinopathy': {
    pathophysiology: `Proximal hamstring tendinopathy is centered around one specific, exquisitely tender spot: the ischial tuberosity, or the "sitting bone." The pain is a deep, localized ache right in the crease of the buttock where the hamstring muscles originate from a thick, shared tendon. The most common mistake people make is treating this like a simple hamstring muscle strain and aggressively stretching it, which often makes it worse. A tendinopathy at the hamstring's origin is sensitive to both compressive and tensile loads. Aggressive stretching places a high tensile load on the tendon, while sitting on it directly compresses it against the ischial tuberosity. Both actions can perpetuate the pain cycle. The condition is often linked to altered running mechanics, commonly an "over-striding" gait where the foot lands too far in front of the body's center of mass, putting massive braking and tensile load on the hamstring at foot strike.`,

  'adductor-related-groin-pain': {
    pathophysiology: `Adductor-related groin pain is the classic "groin pull" story, but it's often more complex than a single event. The biggest misconception is that this is "just a muscle strain" that will heal with a bit of rest and ice. While that might be true for a very minor, first-time strain, recurrent or persistent groin pain is rarely that simple. It's often a sign of an underlying imbalance. The adductor muscles don't just pull your leg inwards; they play a critical role in stabilizing the pelvis. Chronic adductor issues are frequently a symptom of a broader problem, such as weakness in the abdominal muscles, glutes, or a lack of core control.

The adductors are a crucial link in the kinetic chain that transfers force from the legs to the trunk. When an athlete pushes off to skate or cut, the adductors on the stance leg work in concert with the gluteus medius and the obliques to stabilize the pelvis over the leg. If any part of that system is weak (for example, the obliques on the opposite side), the adductors may be forced to take on an excessive amount of stabilizing work, leading to overload and injury.

After a painful groin injury, it's common for athletes to develop a fear of re-injury. They may start to move tentatively, avoiding the powerful, explosive movements their sport requires. This can lead to protective muscle guarding, where the body subconsciously tenses the adductors and other surrounding muscles. This guarding pattern can actually alter movement mechanics and increase the risk of another injury.`,

    clinicalPresentation: {
      primarySymptoms: [
        "Pain in upper inner thigh - usually felt high in groin, close to pubic bone, ranging from dull ache to very sharp, intense pain",
        "Tenderness to touch - adductor longus tendon where it attaches to bone is often very tender to press on",
        "Pain with specific movements - key triggers include sprinting, cutting, kicking, or any movement involving forcefully bringing legs together (adduction)",
        "Pain with 'squeezing' - actively squeezing knees together against resistance will often reproduce the pain",
        "Morning ache and stiffness in groin area upon waking"
      ],
      associatedSymptoms: [
        "Sharp twinge in inner thigh during powerful crossover stride or cut",
        "Pain when striking ball with inside of foot",
        "Sometimes initial memorable 'pop' or tearing sensation",
        "Pain that builds over time, becoming progressively more limiting",
        "Feels fine when walking, but sharp pain with push off, sprint, or change direction",
        "Core weakness or poor pelvic control"
      ],
      typicalPattern: "Classic story is hockey player who feels sharp twinge in their inner thigh during powerful crossover stride, or soccer player who feels it when they plant foot and cut hard to change direction, or when they strike ball with inside of foot. Pain is located high up in groin, right where inner thigh muscles attach to pubic bone. Often more complex than single event - pain that builds over time, becoming progressively more limiting."

    whatToExpect: {
      firstVisit: "When an athlete comes to me with groin pain, my first goal is to clarify the diagnosis. Groin pain is notoriously complex area with many potential sources. I'll ask you to point with one finger to exact spot of maximal pain. I'll ask about mechanism of injury: was it single event or did it build up over time? What specific movements in your sport are most provocative? Have you had this before? A history of recurrent groin strains points strongly towards unaddressed underlying stability issue. My systematic exam includes: careful palpation of groin structures starting away from painful area, squeeze test (squeezing my fist or ball between your knees), adductor muscle length and strength assessment, and importantly - thorough assessment of surrounding muscles including abdominals and gluteals.",
      earlyPhase: "First step is to reduce activities that cause sharp pain - this doesn't mean complete rest. We start with pain-free strengthening, focusing on isometric exercises. The early stages focus heavily on motor control, re-establishing the brain-muscle connection before we start adding heavy loads.",
      progression: "Look beyond the site of pain. We must restore balance of strength and control across entire pelvis and core. Program begins with calming sensitive tissue and progresses systematically to build foundation of strength, and finally, to restore dynamic, high-speed stability required for sport. 8-12 weeks typically required, sometimes longer. Rushing process is most common reason for re-injury."
