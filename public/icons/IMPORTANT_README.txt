IMPORTANT: PWA ICON INSTRUCTIONS

For your Progressive Web App (PWA) to work correctly, please replace the placeholder icon files in this directory with your actual brand icons:

1. Replace icon-192x192.png with your own 192x192 pixel PNG icon
2. Replace icon-512x512.png with your own 512x512 pixel PNG icon

These icons will be displayed when users install your website as an app on their devices.

For the best results, use a professional-quality logo with good contrast that looks clear at small sizes.
